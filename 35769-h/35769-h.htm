<p>The immense extent and beautiful irregularity
of the grounds, the unfathomable depth of the
woods, the picturesque ramifications of some of
the most conspicuously situated of the very old
trees, the hour, for it was almost midnight, the
numerous bonfires scattered in all directions,
the innumerable tenantry gathered round them,
the crowd of moving forms extending as far as
the eye could penetrate into the darkness; and,
quite in the fore-ground, the figure of a blind old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
man who had been born in the family, and grown
grey in its service, playing, with the most extravagant
demonstrations of delight, on a rude
harp, that instrument so surrounded with poetic
associations; seated too beneath a spreading
cedar, the trunk and undermost branches of
which, together with his countenance and white
hair, were strongly illuminated by an adjacent
heap of blazing pine,&mdash;all gave to Arden Park
a demesne of such unlimited magnificence, that
it formed in itself a sort of sylvan empire, a
powerful resemblance, at the moment of which
we speak, to what our imaginations are prone to
figure of the feasts of <i>Shells</i>, as described by
that poet of ancient bards and burning oaks, the
venerable Ossian.</p>

<p>On an abrupt and rocky eminence, at some
distance, but still within the park, stood the
picturesque remains of Arden Castle, once the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
residence of the ancestors of the family. Its
round towers of different dimensions, some still
perfect, its perpendicular site, the trees and turn
of the river at its base, were all rendered conspicuous
by the clear light of the moon now
about to set behind the ruins.</p>

<p>In all the ancient deeds the landed property
derived its designation from this castle, and it was
still customary for the heir to take formal possession
of the roofless walls, ere he was considered
true Lord of the Manor; a ceremony
which had in the course of the day just passed,
been duly performed.</p>

<p>A little removed from the old castle, emerging
from the trees, appeared the square turret of
another ruin, called the Grey Friary, once the
residence of monks, to whom at that time a portion
of the lands appertained, while along the
verge of the horizon, the spires of several churches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
were just visible, breaking the dark line formed
by seemingly interminable woods.</p>

<p>The modern house, a magnificent structure,
standing on a commanding eminence, the
approach to which was gradual in the midst of
a park and woodlands comprising above thirty
thousand acres, now poured from every door
and window streams of cheerful light.</p>

<p>Figures were discernible within, some moving
in the merry dance, others thronging to and from
halls dedicated to hospitable cheer.</p>

<p>We have already said it was near midnight:
the day had been spent in festivities, held to
celebrate the coming of age of Sir Willoughby
Arden, now (his father having been sometime
dead,) the head of the ancient family to whom
the property belonged.</p>

<p>The rejoicings, not only those going forward
beneath the sheltering roof of the mansion but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
those also out of doors, were kept up thus late
in compliment to Alfred Arden, the twin brother
of the heir. The elder twin had been born about
nine in the evening, the younger not till after
twelve at night. To unite, therefore, the two
distinct birth-days in the one festival, and thus
preserve unsevered the more than brotherly tie,
it had been resolved that no guest, of whatever
denomination, should depart till the hour of
midnight had been ushered in with every possible
demonstration of joy.</p>

<p>The county-town, though not above a quarter
of a mile removed, was quite planted out: the
spires already noticed, and which were highly
ornamental to the landscape, being all pertaining
of city scenery, which was visible over the tops
of the trees.</p>

<p>The clocks of some of the churches now began
to strike. A spell at the instant seemed to fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
upon all: the music ceased, the voices of revelry
were hushed, and that peculiar stillness prevailed
which seemed to indicate that every individual in
the crowd was occupied in counting the solemn
chimes. The nearest and loudest bell took
the lead, and was quite distinct from the rest,
while the others followed, like answering echoes,
in the distance. A second after the number
twelve was completed, one universal shout rent
the air! The health of Alfred Arden was drank
within the mansion, and arms might be seen
waving above the heads of the guests: after
which, Sir Willoughby, leading his brother forward,
issued from the open door, and stood on
the centre of the steps.</p>

<p>Servants held up lighted flambeaux on either
side, and the old butler, with hair as white as
the harper's, presented a goblet of wine. Sir
Willoughby announced his brother with enthu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>siasm,
and then drank to the health of Alfred Arden.
A simultaneous movement among the
groups around the bonfires indicated that they
were following his good example, and the next
moment three times three resounded from the
crowd.</p>

<p>In about an hour after this all was still,
save the solitary voice of a distant waterfall.
Every light was quenched, and dying embers,
which from time to time as they fell together
flashed for an instant, were all that remained of
the scattered bonfires. The merry crowd had
sought their respective homes, and the inhabitants
of the mansion had retired to rest, with
the exception of Lady Arden, who sat at an
open window, taking leave as it were of familiar
scenes which, when the light of morning next
dawned upon them, would no longer be her
home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>In marrying the late Sir Alfred, the then
head of the family, in obedience to the wishes
of her parents, she had sacrificed an early attachment
to his youngest brother.</p>

<p>Sir Alfred had, however, proved a very polite
husband, and she had for years been the mistress,
nay, the very princess of a princely mansion,
a splendid establishment, and a magnificent
demesne; she had possessed every luxury that art
and wealth could procure, and at the same time
had been surrounded by all the beauties of nature
on the most extensive scale.</p>

<p>All had now passed away! It was to her
son, 'tis true, and he was dutiful and affectionate,
and would always, she had no doubt, make her
welcome, but of course as a visitor; and whenever
her son should marry (which she certainly
wished him to do), a stranger would be mistress
of all; and to the courtesy of that stranger she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
must owe permission to cross the threshold of
her long accustomed home.</p>

<p>She did not mean absolutely to murmur; but
there was something pensive, at least, if not melancholy
in such thoughts.</p>

<p>While her son was a minor, Arden Park had
still been hers, at least the right of living there;
but to-morrow she was to set out for town; she
was to take her daughters from under the shelter
of their father's roof, to become wanderers
as it were, on the world's wide wilderness. She
would have a house in town, 'tis true: a short
season of each year would be spent there, and
the remainder in temporary and probably agreeable
homes in the various watering-places.
But she felt a painful consciousness, that, of the
adventitious rank which the mere <i>prejudices</i> of
society bestow, herself and daughters would
now lose many steps; and that the latter must,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
whenever she should die, if they were not
married, lose many more; nay, be probably
reduced, at last, by the insufficiency of their
portions as younger children, to the state of poor
aunt Dorothea, whom she had herself often held
up to them as a warning of the miseries attendant
on remaining single.</p>

<p>Aunt Dorothea's afflictions were not always
of the tragic order, and the remembrance of some
of them called up, at the moment, despite her
solemn reflections, a faint smile on the countenance
of Lady Arden; followed, however, by a
sigh, for the subject now came home to her
feelings in a manner it had never done before.</p>

<p>So absorbing had been her reflections, that
she had not noticed the gathering clouds which
had gradually extinguished every star, and darkened
the heavens, till all on which she still
looked out had become one black and formless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
mass. At the instant, a vivid flash of lightning
gave to her view, with the most minute distinctness
of outline, not only the grand features of
the landscape generally, but, prominent above
all, the ruins of the castle, the rocky eminence
on which they stood, the river at its foot, and
the trees that surrounded its base. Thunder
and violent rain followed, and the wind rose to
a hurricane. There existed a superstitious belief
among the country people that a tremendous
tempest always preceded or accompanied
any event fatal to a member of the Arden family.
A remembrance of this crossed the mind of Lady
Arden at the moment, but was of course rejected
as silly to a degree. Besides, she added
mentally, if an idea so absurd required refutation,
the present occasion being one of rejoicing,
would be quite sufficient to satisfy any reasonable
mind. She retired to rest, however, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
saddened feelings, while the castle, crowning its
rocky site, as already described, floated before her
eyes, even after their lids were closed; and when
she slept, the vision still blended with her
dreams, as did the forms of the Baron and his
two sons, described in the legend of the
castle, and all strangely mixed up with the
festivities of the previous day, and the forms of
her own happy blooming family.</p>

<p>The legend alluded to, and which had given
rise to the superstition we have mentioned, ran
thus.</p>

<p>Some centuries ago, the Baron had two sons,
who, when boys, had climbed, one day, during
a fearful thunder storm to the topmost turret of
the castle, which was at the time enveloped in
clouds.</p>

<p>When, however, the storm was over, their
bodies were found, locked in each other's arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
laying in the river at the foot of the rock on
which the castle stands. The old Baron died
of grief, and the property went to a distant relative,
who, it was vaguely hinted, had followed
the youths unseen, and while they stood gazing
at the storm, had treacherously drawn the coping-stone
from beneath their feet; others maintained
the only grounds for this foul suspicion to be,
that the said stone was certainly found on the
inner side the parapet, while the bodies of the
youths lay below.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>When Lady Arden arose in the morning all
was calm and sunshine.</p>

<p>The storm of the night might have seemed a
dream but for the still visible traces of its
ravages. The river was greatly swollen, and several
of the largest and finest of a range of
magnificent old trees which had grown on the
brow of a sloping bank, forming a beautiful
feature in the landscape, now lay on the ground,
literally uprooted by the violence of the tempest.
Their fate, however, was soon forgotten
in that of two young oaks, which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
planted beside each other on the lawn, on the
joint birth-day of her two sons. The lightning
had shattered both: Lady Arden viewed them
for the moment with a shuddering sensation
of superstitious dread, the influence of which it
required all her good sense to resist.</p>

<p>Geoffery Arden, the only nephew of the late Sir
Alfred, was standing on the grass, with his arms
folded, and looking rather askance than directly
at the remains of the blasted trees, while his
eye-brows were drawn up contemptuously, and
a somewhat scornful smile curled his lip, as he
marked blind Lewin the Harper, his countenance
full of woe, feeling, with visibly trembling
hands, each shattered branch of the uprooted
oaks, while the large tears were falling from his
sightless eyes.</p>

<p>The brothers Willoughby and Alfred, and
their three sisters, all seemingly attracted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the same object, issued one by one, from the
open glass door of the breakfast room, and gathered
round the spot; each looked playfully
dismal for a moment, and the next uttered
some laughing remark. They were soon joined
by their mother; and the group would have
formed a striking family picture. Lady Arden
was still a very fine woman: from her mild temper
the sweetness of her countenance was yet unimpaired,
while the expression of maternal tenderness,&mdash;and
this from the late tenor of her
thoughts was unconsciously mingled with something
of solicitude,&mdash;with which she viewed her
children, her sons now especially, and Alfred in
particular, her favourite son, gave additional
interest to her appearance.</p>

<p>Alfred's sparkling eye and blooming cheek
did not, however, seem to justify much anxiety
on his account; his brother too, though he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
always been more delicate, seemed at present
in excellent health and spirits, while the three
sisters were young, handsome, and happy looking.
Geoffery Arden still stood apart, as though
there were but little fellowship of feeling between
him and the rest of the group.</p>

<p>He was a lad of eighteen or nineteen
before the marriage of his uncle, the late Sir
Alfred; and from a child had been in the
habit of hearing his father and mother, and
such of their particular friends as sought to
flatter their secret wishes, speculate on the possibility
of his uncle's never marrying, and his
being consequently heir to the Arden estates,
which were strictly entailed in the male line.
Nay, his very nursemaid's usual threat was, that
if he cried when his face was being washed, he
should never be Sir Geoffery. At school, all the
boys at play hours had somehow or other a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>cquired
the habit of calling him Sir Geoffery; and
at college his companions, particularly those who
wished to flatter him into idle extravagance,
constantly joked and complimented him about
his great <i>expectations</i>. Thus had those expectations,
unjustly founded as they were, grown
with his growth and strengthened with his
strength; till, when his uncle did marry, he
could scarcely help thinking himself an injured,
robbed, and very ill-treated person. Hope however
revived a little, on the first three children
chancing to be daughters, and his mother began
again to say, he might have the Arden estates
yet:&mdash;stranger things had happened. "And
you might marry one of the girls, you know,
Geoffery," she would continue,&mdash;"it would be
some compensation to poor Sir Alfred for having
no son."</p>

<p>"Indeed I should do no such thing," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
would reply. "I should just please myself.
It's not to oblige me, I suppose, that my uncle
has no son."</p>

<p>The birth of the twin brothers, immediately
after this, put an end to all further speculations
on the subject; except, indeed, that Mrs. Arden
could not help observing that, "after all, the
lives of two weakly infants, as twins of course
must be, with the measles, hooping-cough, and
all other infantile diseases before them, were
not worth much."</p>

<p>Geoffery became sulky under his disappointment,
and said very little; but silently he hated
the twins for having been born. Of what use
were they, he thought; for what purpose had
they been brought into the world, except indeed
to ruin his prospects.</p>

<p>Had they never been born, they would not
have wanted the property, and he might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
enjoyed it. Now he must go and drudge at a
profession, the very idea of which, after his
imagination had been so long dazzled by false
hopes, he absolutely loathed.</p>

<p>He had been educated for the Bar, but had
neglected his studies. He had been dissipated
without gaiety of heart, and a gambler from
avarice. His hopes had made him proud, while
his fears had made him gloomy. In short, he
had contrived to extract the evil from every
thing, while he had avoided all that was good.
As to his legal studies, he had never read any
portion with interest or attention but the law of
male entail.</p>

<p>He was a bachelor, and likely to remain
such: for he could not afford to marry, unless
he obtained a much larger fortune than he was
entitled to expect.</p>

<p>There was nothing he could exactly dare to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
do to injure his cousins; but he hated them
both, and kept an evil eye upon them. As for
his female cousins, he did not take the trouble
of actively hating them, he merely despised them
as beings shut out from all possibility of inheriting
the property. Beautiful and high born as
they were, he would not have accepted the
hand of any one of them had it been offered to
him.</p>

<p>Sir Willoughby was goodnaturedly weak, and
very vain;&mdash;his was a vanity however which,
when it happened to be gratified, made him extremely
happy, by keeping him in the highest
good humour with himself. From him Geoffery
won large sums at billiards, by flattering him on
his play, 'till he induced him to give him,
habitually, such odds as amounted, in point of
fact, to giving him the game, or, in other words,
the sum staked upon it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Arden often endeavoured to dissuade
her son from acquiring so bad a habit as that
of gambling, but in vain; for Willoughby, like
all weak men, was obstinate to excess: he had
besides a marvellous respect for the salique law,
and that jealousy of being guided, which unhappily
always forms a leading feature in the
characters of those who stand most in need of
guidance. Yet he was fondly attached to his
mother; his greatest delight was to devise something
for her pleasure or her accommodation; he
was always ready to make her munificent presents;
in short, he would do any thing to oblige her,
with the exception of following her suggestions.</p>

<p>Not that he always ungraciously refused requests
that contained in them nothing prohibitory;
he had no particular objection sometimes to
do a thing he was asked to do; but a thing
he was asked not to do, he was always sure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
do! And if it happened to be a thing which
Geoffery Arden wished should be done, he could
always decide the point, by artfully complimenting
his cousin on the <i>firmness</i> of his character.</p>

<p>Of Alfred, Geoffery could make nothing.
He was frank, kind, and open-hearted; yet
clear-seeing and decided. With him his mother's
slightest wish but guessed at was a law:
his sisters, too, could always coax him out
of any plan of pleasure of his own, and get
him to go with them. Not so those for whom
he had no particular affection; he had never
yet been known, in any one instance, to sacrifice
his opinion of what was right, respectable,
or amiable, to the persuasions of idle
companions; so that he was already respected
as well as regarded by thinking and discerning
men much older than himself; some of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
too, men who had bought their experience dearly
enough and who were surprised into involuntary
admiration of so young a person, who
seemed to have his intuitively.</p>

<p>His brother loved him in the most enthusiastic
manner; more than he did his mother, or
any one else in the world; yet, strange to say,
such was Willoughby's dread of being governed,
that even the brother whom he loved so much,
had not the slightest influence over him; nay,
Alfred was afraid to use persuasion of any
kind, lest it should have a contrary effect; and
yet, if he ever let it appear that he was in the
slightest degree hurt or offended by this unmeaning
and dogged obstinacy on the part of his
brother, Willoughby's despair would sometimes,
though but for a moment or two, manifest itself in
a way perfectly terrifying; he would rush towards
a window, or a river side, and threaten to fling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
himself out or in; so that Alfred, though he
knew himself to be his brother's sole confidant,
and the first object of his affections, was obliged,
with great pain of course, to see him led away
by designing people, especially his cousin Geoffery,
into many practices far from prudent, yet
not interfere; and even be thankful, when by
refraining from so doing, he could avoid the recurrence
of the distressing scenes alluded to.
Willoughby had received a blow on the head
when a child, which had not then exhibited any
serious consequences; whether this circumstance
had any connection with the occasional strangeness
of his temper or not, it was impossible to
say, but Alfred sometimes secretly feared it
had. It was a thought, however, which he did
not communicate even to his mother. Such was
the family, which on the morning we have described,
quitted Arden Park for London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>While the Arden family are on their way to
town, we shall take a peep at the High-street in
Cheltenham. Strings of carriages were driving
backward and forward, from turnpike to turnpike,
while the open barouches, filled with bonnets
of every colour in the rainbow, flaunting
and waving to and fro, looked like so many
moving beds of full blown tulips. Foot-passengers
too of all classes thronged the flag-ways.</p>

<p>Among these was distinguishable a tall, large,
and still handsome woman, apparently upwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of fifty. There was something aristocratic about
both her countenance and carriage, although
she was closely followed by a trollopy looking
maid-servant, who carried a bandbox under each
arm, a dressing-box in one hand, and a work-box
in the other.</p>

<p>Mistress and maid entered the private door
or <i>genteel</i> separate ingress, appropriated to
lodgers, of a music-shop; and having the door
at the further end of the passage opened, for the
purpose of throwing light on the subject, stumbled
up a still dark and very narrow staircase,
at the top of which they turned abruptly into
a small sunny drawing-room, furnished with
chintz hangings, lined and draperied with faded
pink calico. The carpet was a stamped cloth,
of a showy pattern. It was a recent purchase,
and therefore not yet faded; so that it secured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to these lodgings, as being <i>superiorly</i> furnished,
a great preference over their competitors. In
the centre of the room stood a table covered
with a very dingy green baize, and round the
walls were ranged some half dozen small mock
rosewood chairs, accommodated with little square
inclined planes, covered with pink calico, and
called cushions. Either for want of strings at
the back, or in consequence of such strings
being out of repair, these said inclined planes,
whenever you attempted to help yourself or any
one else to a chair, flew off, either into the middle
of the floor, or if it was the fire you had
wished to approach, perchance under the grate.
Over the mantelpiece was placed what the landlady
considered <i>a very handsome</i> chimney-glass,
a <i>foot and half</i> high, and about three wide;
its gilt frame carefully covered with transparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
yellow gauze. On the mantelpiece stood two
bronze chimney lights, with cutglass drops,
only it must be confessed there were but three
of the drops remaining on one, and the other
wanted two. The woman of the house, however,
had promised faithfully to find the rest
of the drops, and so restore to these embellishers
of her establishment the whole of their
pendant honours.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't give much for their promises,"
answered Sarah, the maid, when, in reply to
a comment of hers on the subject, she was told
so by Mrs. Dorothea Arden, her mistress.</p>

<p>"And here's no sofa, ma'am," she continued;
"how are you to be sitting, the length of an
evening, stuck upright on one of these here
<i>ricketty</i> bits of chairs, I'd be glad to know."</p>

<p>"Why, it will not be very comfortable, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
sure," answered Mrs. Dorothea, "so long as it
lasts; but she has promised faithfully, that as
soon as the sick lady goes away, which will be
in about a week, she will let me have the sofa
out of the next drawing-room."</p>

<p>"A bird in the hand's worth two in the bush!"
replied Sarah. "I dare say if the truth was
known, they're not worth a sofa; or, if they are,
they'll keep it in the next room, when it is vacant,
to be a decoy-duck to another lodger. They're
not going to let you have it, I promise you, now
that they have got you fast for a month certain."</p>

<p>"Well, if they don't, I can't help it," said
Mrs. Dorothea; "one can't have every thing
you know; and the new carpet certainly gives
the room a very respectable appearance. And
then there is a chiffonier; that's a great comfort
to put one's groceries in; or a few biskets; or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
bottle of wine, if one should be obliged to open
one. The doors, to be sure, are lined with blue
and they should have been pink."</p>

<p>"And here's no key," said Sarah, examining
the chiffonier; "and I declare if the lock <i>ante</i>
broke."</p>

<p>"That is provoking," said Mrs. Dorothea,
"she must get me a lock."</p>

<p>Sarah was now dispatched with her bandboxes,
and ordered to hurry the dinner and unpack
the things.</p>

<p>In about half an hour, Aunt Dorothea becoming
hungry and impatient, rang her bell. Sarah
reappeared, with a countenance of the utmost
discontent, declaring she was never in such a
place in her life; that there was no getting any
thing done, and that as to unpacking, there was
no use in attempting it, in a place where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
should never be able to stop. When the dinner
was asked for, she replied, that she believed it
had been done some time, but that she supposed
there was no one to bring it up, for all they
had engaged to do the waiting. "But there's
sixteen of themselves, shop boys and all; and
they <i>gets</i> their own tea the while your dinner's
a cooking it seems."</p>

<p>When the dinner did come up, it was cold, and
consisted of mutton-chops, which had evidently
been upset into the ashes. Poor Aunt Dorothea
consequently made but a slender repast.</p>

<p>The next day, while engaged in the labours
of the toilet, she thus addressed Sarah; for
people who live quite alone, are too apt to get
into a way of gossiping with their servants.</p>

<p>"It's a very long time since the Salters
have called; is it not, Sarah?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"A very long time indeed ma'am," replied
the abigail, "they was a saying to their own
maid the other day (they don't know I suppose
as she is a friend of mine), for they was a saying,
as I said, that they didn't think as they should
call any more; for that nobody never knew
where to find you, as you was always a changing
your lodgings; and that as to your having
a sister that was a lady, they didn't believe a
word of it; for though you was always a talking
of Lady Arden coming, she never come."</p>

<p>"What impertinence! Well, Lady Arden
will be here this season to a certainty. She is
to come direct from London; and I'll take care
they shall not be introduced to her. Was there
ever such ingratitude! People that had not a
creature to speak to, till I introduced them to
every one they know. I even made so particu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>lar
a request of my friends that they would call
on them, that I quite laid myself under obligations
to people. They could find out my lodgings
fast enough, when they were coming to my
little sociable parties five nights out of the
seven; declaring they did not know what
was to become of them, were it not for my
kindness; and that the more they saw how
differently others behaved to them, the more
were they obliged to me; and then making such
a vulgar noise about the number of invitations
they were in my debt and their grief at not
having it in their power as yet to make any return."</p>

<p>"Then I can tell you ma'am," said Sarah,
"they are to have a grand party this very night
at the rooms, and never had the manners to ask
you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know their cards have been out for some
time. And who are they to have, did you
hear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, titles without end, they say; and generals
and baronets, and all sorts of fine people.
Mrs. Johnson <i>sais</i>, as the young ladies should
say, they were determined as their party should
<i>exist</i> entirely of <i>excuses</i>."</p>

<p>"Exclusives you mean, I suppose; but did
you hear any of the names?"</p>

<p>"Why yes ma'am; they are to have Sir
Matthias and Lady Whaleworthy."</p>

<p>"Sir Matthias indeed!" repeated Mrs. Dorothea,
"an alderman cheesemonger, knighted
only the other day; and as for his poor goodnatured,
vulgar wife, she has been fattened on
whey, I suppose, till no reasonable door can
admit her."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well to be sure!" exclaimed the abigail,
"and then they are to have Sir Henry and Lady
Shawbridge."</p>

<p>"Sir Henry, poor man," said Mrs. Dorothea,
"was only knighted by mistake. I don't know
what he was himself, but they say he had just
married his cook-maid; and her ladyship certainly
has all the fiery-faced fierceness of that
order about her."</p>

<p>"A cook-maid, ma'am! why I am a step
above that myself. And let me see, who else&mdash;oh,
there's to be Lady Flamborough."</p>

<p>"She is a woman of rank certainly, or rather
the widow of a man of rank; for she is of very
low birth herself; and what is much worse, she
is a woman of bad character, which of course
prevents her being visited, so that she is glad to
go any where. And who else pray?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir William Orm, that Mrs. Johnson <i>sais</i>
is such a fine gentleman."</p>

<p>"Sir William Orm," repeated Mrs. Dorothea,
"he is a known black-leg; a man shut out from
all good society; he may do very well for the
Salters, however, if he can endure their vulgarity."</p>

<p>"There is another title," said Sarah, "let me
see&mdash;Sir&mdash;Sir&mdash;Sir Francis Beerton, or Brierton,
I think."</p>

<p>"Poor little man," said Mrs. Dorothea, "there
is no particular harm in him; but his wife is so
sanctified, that she will neither go any where,
nor see any one at home; so that he is glad of
any thing for variety. Strange notions some
people have of duty! in my opinion, if a woman
will not make a man's home comfortable and
agreeable to him, she becomes accountable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
all the sins he may commit abroad, although she
should be praying for his conversion the whole
time. Well, who comes next on your list?"</p>

<p>"I don't think as I remember any more, excepting
General Powel."</p>

<p>"He, poor old man, is mere lumber; neither
useful nor ornamental, nobody will be troubled
with him who can get anybody else to fill up
their rooms; so that I should suppose he is not
incumbered with many invitations."</p>

<p>"Well who would a thought of their being
such a <i>despisable</i> set; and so many titles
among them too; why to have heard Mrs.
Johnson talk o' them, you'd supposed they had
been so many kings and queens."</p>

<p>"It was a set I should not have joined certainly;
but quite good enough for the Salters,
whom I should never have visited, had the friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
who wrote to me about them been sufficiently
explicit as to who and what they were. The
daughters, I suppose, would be excessively indignant
if they thought it was known that their
father had made his fortune somewhere in Devonshire,
by a contract for supplying the navy
with beef."</p>

<p>"Supplying beef, ma'am! Why isn't that all
as one as being a butcher?"</p>

<p>"Not unlike it, certainly," replied Mrs. Dorothea.</p>

<p>"Well, who would have thought, and they
so proud: but it's always them there upstartish
sort that's the impudentst and most
unbearable."</p>

<p>"It is in general the way those sort of people
betray themselves. If they behaved in a modest
unpretending manner, very possible no questions
might be asked. After their ingratitude and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
impertinence to me, I for one shall make no
secret of the circumstance. And the very young
men that eat Mr. Salter's roast beef now, washed
down too with his champaign and his claret, will
not be the less ready to jeer at the time he sold
the same commodity raw. When my sister,
Lady Arden, comes, and her three beautiful
daughters, they will of course have all the
young men in Cheltenham about them; so that
I shall be acquainted with them all; and I shall
take care they shall not be in the dark about
the Misses Salter, who shall find that I am not
to be insulted with impunity."</p>

<p>"And I shall have some fun with our butcher
about it," said Sarah; "I shall tell him to be
particular what sort of meat he sends to such
a good judge as Mr. Salter. Perhaps you could
spare me for a couple of hours this evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
ma'am?" she added, when her mistress was
attired.</p>

<p>"What for, Sarah? you are always asking
leave to go out. I must say you are very idly
inclined. How are my summer things ever to
be ready at this rate. This mulberry silk has
been looking quite out of season, ever since the
sunny weather came in."</p>

<p>"I am sure, ma'am, there is not a young
person in Cheltenham sits as close to their
needle as what I do; but this evening Mrs.
Johnson has, of course, the privilege of the
music-gallery, and she has offered me a place.
I thought you might like, perhaps, to hear how
the party went off?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly I should!" replied Mrs. Dorothea.
"Well, Sarah, you may go, and mind
you have all your eyes about you, and bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
me a full account of every thing. And notice
if there is any body there that I know&mdash;and
how the people are dressed&mdash;and how often the
refreshment trays come in&mdash;and whether they
attempt a supper&mdash;and who begins the dancing.
The Miss Salters will get partners for once in
their lives, I suppose! And I dare say they will
contrive to have a tolerably full room; for I
hear they have been getting all their acquaintance
to give away cards, right and left; Lady
Matthias alone boasts that she has disposed of
three dozen."</p>

<p>Sarah promised strict compliance with all the
directions she had received, and disappeared in
great haste, to pin new bows in her bonnet, and
slip stiffeners into the large sleeves of her best
silk dress; determining to complete her costume
for the occasion, by lending herself her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
mistress's pea-green china crape shawl and
black lace veil.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dorothea Arden, as soon as she was
alone, sighed unconsciously; for visions of her
early days presented themselves suddenly and
unbidden, forming a violent contrast with the
whole class of petty and degrading thoughts and
interests, to which circumstances had gradually
habituated, at least, if not reconciled her.</p>

<p>Ere she had quitted the pedestal of her youthful
pride, beneath the shelter of her father's
roof, with what appalling horror would she have
thought of the chance-collected mob, about
whose movements she was now capable of feeling
an idle curiosity.</p>

<p>Vague recollections, too, passed with the
quickness of a momentary glance, through her
mind, of eligible establishments rejected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
scorn, of comfort and respectability cast away,
for dreams of ambition it had never been her
fate to realize.</p>

<p>She paused, and some seconds were given to
a remembrance apart from every other, which,
though now but faintly seen amid the haze of
distance, still seemed a little illumined speck,
on which a sun-beam, piercing some aperture in
a cloudy sky had chanced to fall.</p>

<p>But it was too late, quite too late for such
thoughts, so she went out to pay some morning
visits, to send in a veal cutlet for her dinner,
and find out, more particularly, who were to be
at the Salter's party.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>Mr. Salter and his two daughters, the former
equipped in a new wig, the latter in two new
dresses, expressly for the occasion, were parading
up and down the yet vacant public ballroom.</p>

<p>The lights were burning, the waiters in attendance,
and the orchestra playing; while,
peeping over the shoulder of the double bass,
appeared a particularly smart bonnet, decorated
with numerous bows of quite new ribbon,
and further graced by a very handsome
black lace veil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"What can all the people be thinking of?"
said Mr. Salter at last; "I have a mind to order
the lights to be put out, and go away home to
my bed. It would be just a proper punishment
for them all. And pray," he added, looking
at his daughters' dresses, "what are these gig-meries
to cost?" At this crisis resounded the
welcome sounds, "Sir Matthias and Lady
Whaleworthy:" with quickened steps and delighted
countenances, our trio hastened towards
the bottom of the room, to receive their guests,
now, as by magic, flowing in altogether.</p>

<p>Introductions were endless; every leading
bird was followed by a flock, which neither host
nor hostess had ever seen before; while, from
time to time, the promised titles, those stars
which were to give brilliancy to the night, made
their appearance, sprinkling the common herd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
with consequence. Lady Flamborough! Sir
William Orm! Sir Henry and Lady Shawbridge!
Next appeared poor old General Powel
and half blind Sir Francis Brierton, poking his
little sharp nose into everybody's face, and
smirking his recognition, when by so doing he
had discovered who they were; and though last
not least, Sir James Lindsey; least in consequence
we mean, for he was a very little, very
ugly man, the express image of the knave of
spades. He was, however, a vastly important
personage, a bachelor baronet, with fifteen thousand
a-year, and a man of good family too, so
that there was no objection whatever to him,
except that he was a fool, and that when he
danced he so capered and kicked up behind,
and rounded his elbows, and, in short, made
himself so completely the butt and laughing-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>stock
of the whole room, it was with difficulty
that even his fifteen thousand per annum could
procure him a partner.</p>

<p>We rather suspect, however, that there were
ladies who, though they shrank from sharing
with Sir James the unprofitable ridicule of the
hour, would have had no objection to share
with him for life his fifteen thousand a-year,
for, in that case, they could afford to be laughed
at.</p>

<p>Sir James had a brother, a very fine young
man, remarkably handsome and equally clever;
perhaps a little too hot-headed, but
warm-hearted withal; an enthusiast in beauty,
painting, music, scenery, every thing in short
at which a glowing imagination takes fire;
the very material for a frantic lover, yet condemned
by his circumstances, either to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
a single life, or possibly at least contract a marriage
with the purse of some old rich widow,
fitter to be his mother than his wife. For
Henry Lindsey was one of the many living sacrifices
hourly immolated on the altars of <i>pride</i>,
and how many a holocaust has been offered up
upon those altars!</p>

<p>How often have we heard persons, who could
argue rationally enough on other subjects, gravely
assert, in reply to every argument which good
feeling or justice could urge, "A family must
have a head."</p>

<p>In this particular instance the head, or <i>pride</i>
of the family, had proved its disgrace, yet standing
laws and previously made settlements could
not be altered. Fifteen thousand per annum,
therefore, must be melted down, to make a
golden image of poor little silly Sir James,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
while Henry, with the pittance which as a
younger child was his portion, was obliged to
purchase the privilege of being shot at; for the
younger brother of an old baronet <i>could not disgrace
his family</i> by doing any thing likely to
provide <i>comfortably for himself</i>.</p>

<p>Thus do the <i>prejudices</i> of society seem to have
been invented for the express purpose of hunting
down and crushing those whom its laws have
robbed and oppressed.</p>

<p>Children of the same parents must be defrauded
of the birthright, by natural justice
theirs, to heap all on one brother! And for
what purpose? That he may keep alive, by
being its living representative, that <i>pride</i>, that
<i>curse</i>, which forbids to those so defrauded, the
use of honest means for earning honest bread!</p>

<p>If, instead of this, all property which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
been a father's, were, at his death, equally divided
among his offspring, without revolution or
confiscation, extravagant disparity of station
would gradually disappear, and with it <i>pride</i>,
that destroys the happiness, with its whole array
of <i>prejudices</i>, waging eternal warfare against
rational contentment.</p>

<p>How many are there who might still, even as
the world now is, dwell within a very garden of
Eden, of peaceful and natural delights, and yet
who virtually turn themselves out of the same;
and, at the mere mandate of some <i>prejudice</i> of society&mdash;some
<i>by-law</i> of <i>pride</i>, become wanderers
through the thistle-grown wildernesses of discontent,
or weary pilgrims amid the thorny
paths of petty mortification.</p>

<p>But to return to our ball: by this time so
fair a proportion of the company had arrived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
that it was thought advisable to commence
dancing. For this purpose Mr. Salter, with
a feeling of exultation which made him forget,
for the time, what the whole entertainment was
likely to cost, led Lady Flamborough to the
head of the room. Her ladyship had evidently
been pretty in her youth; but though the remains
of a fine woman may sometimes be
viewed with a blending of admiration with our
veneration, mere prettiness seldom grows old
gracefully. In Lady Flamborough's case it certainly
did not. Her once nicely rounded little figure
had now outgrown all bounds, not excepting
those of the drapery which ought to have concealed
its exuberance. Her once infantine features
were now nearly lost in the midst of a
countenance disproportionally increased in its
general dimensions; while in manner she still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
played off numberless once becoming, but now
disgusting, airs of artless innocence; languishing,
lisping, and rolling her eyes; and childishly
twisting her fingers through the ringlets of her
hair, while looking up in her partner's face, and
saying silly things.</p>

<p>Had it been possible to have checked coquetry
in Lady Flamborough, the sight of the senseless
bloated countenance on which she was thus
casting away those interesting appeals of her
visual orbs, one would have thought might have
done so.</p>

<p>Mr. Salter's head was in shape something
like a sugar loaf: the region denominated fore-head,
and appropriated by phrenologists to the
intellectual faculties, being so confined, that it
nearly came to a point, while the descent
widened as it approached the organs of gusta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>tiveness,
and all that called itself face, concluded
without any distinct line of demarcation, in a
jole, much resembling that of a cod-fish.</p>

<p>The eyes were colourless, and owed all the
brilliancy they possessed to an inflammation of
the lids, which never forsook them. The efforts
of their owner, on the present occasion, to give
them a languishing roll, that should correspond
with that of her ladyship's, was truly ludicrous.
As to his mouth, it bisected his countenance
from ear to ear, which rendered his
endeavours to spread it wider by that bland
movement designated a smile, nearly abortive.</p>

<p>A few additional lines of circular or spherical
trigonometry were conspicuously marked upon
cheeks that yielded in carnation hue to nought
save the nose; while this rallying point of the
vital powers, like certain well-known altars of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the ancients, never allowed the flame to go
out.</p>

<p>Mr. Salter was exceedingly proud of his legs,
(not that he had seen them himself for the last
ten years), and though short for his body, which
by-the-by had precisely the appearance of a
Brobdingnag melon on castors, the legs themselves,
when you were distant enough to have a
view of them beneath the inflated balloon that
otherwise concealed them, were certainly
formed according to the rules of beauty; that is
to say, they had very large calves, and very small
ankles.</p>

<p>We suppose it must have been the combined
effect of the personal charms and the elevated
rank of his partner, which raised Mr. Salter's
spirits to so inconvenient a degree, as to produce
in his mind a most frisky longing to behold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
once more, this long remembered attraction of
his own&mdash;his said handsome legs. Accordingly,
while setting to the lady, he made several kicks
out in front, with accompanying jerks forward
of the head, in the vain hope of catching a
glimpse; but, alas, in one unfortunate effort
more strenuous than the rest, he lost his balance;
out flew his feet, and down he came on his back,
so much to the amusement of the whole room
that no one for a time had the presence of mind
to pick him up: while there he lay, sprawling
and puffing, his own endeavours to rise being
quite as fruitless as those of a beetle usually are,
when placed in the same reversed position by
a mischievous school-boy. Neither was the
evening by any means one of unmixed delight
to the Misses Salter. It was but too evident
that even on the present occasion, when, if ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
compliment was due to them, that the gentlemen
evinced any thing but impatience to secure the
felicity of being their partners. On the contrary,
it was generally when a quadrille was
nearly made up, and the last added couple
were in great distress for a <i>vis--vis</i>, that some
one who had previously made up his mind not to
dance, was pressed into the service, and given a
hint that one of the Miss Salters was sitting down.</p>

<p>Even Sir James, though he did dance a set
with each sister, did not do so till he had been
shaken off by nearly every other woman in the
room.</p>

<p>The Scotch proverb says, "It's a lucky lass
that's like her father."</p>

<p>But we must confess, we never could discover
that it was any advantage to Miss Salter to be
so strikingly like her father as she certainly was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Miss Grace Salter was altogether of a different
style; she was under-sized, pitiably thin,
and extremely dark, with an expression of countenance
as if she had just swallowed something
unseasonably bitter, and was making a face at
its disagreeable flavour. The set with Sir James
could not much sooth the vanity of either sister,
for no sooner did he commence operations,
than a ring was immediately formed for the
avowed purpose of laughing at him; while he,
mistaking the general attention he drew for
admiration, seemed gratefully determined to
spare no pains to give the greatest possible satisfaction
to his numerous spectators.</p>

<p>The Misses Salter had also another source
of uneasiness this evening. At all times their
greatest earthly apprehension, next to that of
not getting husbands themselves, was, lest their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
father should marry, and cut them out of a
small sum, which not having been swallowed
up in the purchase of the estate for John,
he had promised to divide between them unless
indeed he married again. His doing so seemed
this evening more probable than ever it had
done before. The roll of his eye, while looking
at Lady Flamborough, had become quite ominous,
while her ladyship's air of condescension
was truly alarming.</p>

<p>"Now it would be too bad, would it not?"
said Miss Salter to Miss Grace Salter, as they
were undressing, "if after all, this ball that we
have been so long teazing at my father to give,
and that he thinks so much about the expense of,
should turn out to be our own ruin in the end."</p>

<p>"Why, I am afraid, to be sure," replied her
sister, "if he marries he won't leave us the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
money, or else it would be a grand connection!
wouldn't it? We'd be sure to be visited by every
body then."</p>

<p>"That we should, no doubt," said Miss
Salter, "but what of that, we shouldn't have
a shilling in the world, comparatively speaking,
when my father dies&mdash;and as for John&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't give us a shilling if we were
starving!" observed Miss Grace.</p>

<p>By John, they meant their brother. And, by-the-by,
one of the reasons, in addition to their
want of beauty, why these ladies were paid so
little attention to by the gentlemen, was, that it
was well known, Mr. Salter had a cub of a
son, on whom he meant, in imitation of his
betters, to heap the earnings and savings of his
life, for the purpose, as he himself expressed it,
of making a family: and, for that matter he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
didn't see why a man mightn't be prouder of
being the first of his name to do so, than if he
was come of a family ready made to his hand
a thousand years ago! for sure, they must all
have had a beginning one time or other.</p>

<p>But as to being the first of his name to have
a rise in the world, he was not so clear of that
neither: he had often heard talk of a Lord Salter
or Salisbury, or something beginning with an S;
and he might become a lord, one time or
other, for any thing he knew to the
contrary.</p>

<p>But be that as it may, "he wasn't going
to have his money, that he had been a lifetime
scraping together, squandered by idle fellows
that were nothing at all akin to him, but would
just come and marry his daughters to get hold
of the cash."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"But supposing, Sir, we shouldn't get married
at all," said Miss Salter one day.</p>

<p>"Nothing more likely," replied her father.
"As for Grace, she is certainly as plain a girl
as I'd desire to see any day. And I don't know
how it is, you're not very handsome neither, tho'
you're thought so like me."</p>

<p>These observations of Mr. Salter's about
being the first of his family were, by the particular
desire of his daughters, strictly confined
to his own fireside. There was no occasion,
they argued, to make any such confession in a
place like Cheltenham, where nobody knew anything
about people, but what they choose to
say of themselves. Accordingly, they made
family their constant theme; and inquired with
the most consequential airs about the connections
of every one they heard named; always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
winding up their harangue by observing, that
of course it was very natural for a man like their
father, of such an ancient and highly respectable
family, to be very particular about who they
visited, particularly in those sorts of places
where people of every description congregated.</p>

<p>"It's no harm, you know," said Miss Salter
to her sister, "to have the name of being particular,
it makes people of consequence; at
the same time I'd have us get acquainted
with every creature we can, and go everywhere;
there's no knowing where one might
find one's luck."</p>

<p>"Talking of luck," answered Grace, "I read
in one of the new novels the other day, that
'luck knocks once at every one's door;' I wish
it would knock once at mine, I know, and it
shouldn't have to knock again."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"And, by-the-by, was it quite prudent of us,
on your plan, to cut Mrs. Dorothea Arden as we
have done?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; what's the use of an old maid,
she can have no sons, you know; besides, we
didn't cut her till Lady Whaleworthy, and
Lady Flamborough, and Lady Shawbridge,
and all of them, had called; and then I thought
we could spare such old lumber as Mrs. Dorothea."</p>

<p>"Why, to be sure, as you say, she can have
no sons; indeed I never even heard her speak
of a brother or a nephew; and as to her expecting
this Lady Arden that she is always
talking about, I am sure its nothing but a
boast."</p>

<p>"Nothing more you may be certain! And
then I was afraid my father would have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
a fancy to her at last, for he was always saying,
she was a fine woman for her years."</p>

<p>"She was very useful however at first," said
Grace.</p>

<p>"Oh yes she was, certainly," replied Miss
Salter, "but now you know we don't want her."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>Lady Arden, leaning on her son Alfred, her
eldest daughter on the other side, her two
younger following, had just entered the ballroom
at Almacks.</p>

<p>The sisters, we have already said, were beautiful.
They were all above the middle height,
and finely formed; remarkably fair, with brilliant
complexions, and very beautiful light
brown hair.</p>

<p>Jane, the eldest, had her mother's amiable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
mild, regular features, and soft, modest, hazel
eyes.</p>

<p>Louisa, the second, much resembled her sister
in the form of her features, except that her
mouth was a very little larger, the lips fuller,
and of a more vivid red, and the smile more
conscious. Her eyes were of a grey colour,
clear and sparkling; but in their expression
there was too much of triumph, while her very
blush had something in it of the same character;
you felt, you knew not why, that it did not arise
altogether from timidity.</p>

<p>Her beauty, however, was perfectly exquisite;
there was a rich luxuriance, a beaming lustre
about her whole appearance, which seemed to
gain by contrast with others, whom, while viewed
separately, you had thought as handsome. It
was like the undefinable distinction between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
brilliant and its best imitations, most clearly
seen when subjected to the ordeal of comparison.</p>

<p>Madeline, the youngest, had a rounder face
than her sisters, the features not quite so fine,
yet lovely in their own perfectly innocent joyousness;
while beautifying dimples accompanied
her smiles, and fairy cupids danced in her
laughing eyes.</p>

<p>The sisters always dressed alike: on the present
occasion, they all wore white lace over
white satin; the lighter or outer drapery looped
up on one side with a bunch of white roses,
mixed with lilies of the valley: and a few of the
same flowers in the hair on the contrary side.
A set of diamonds each, unusually costly for
girls, but which, by a whim of their maternal
grandfather, they happened to possess, were their
only ornaments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Arden had never, since her widowhood,
returned to colours; her invariable costume was
black velvet; her diamonds, however, yielded
in magnificence to those of royalty only. So
that, what with the faces being quite new, and
the appearance of the group altogether, not forgetting
the handsome Alfred, was such as to excite
considerable attention, even amid an assembly
like the present, where youth, beauty,
fashion, and splendour, habitually congregate.</p>

<p>Willoughby was too important a personage
to form one of the family picture. He was in
the room, however, having just arrived in attendance
on a party with whom he had dined.</p>

<p>A young lady of remarkable beauty was leaning
on his arm. He addressed her from time
to time with great animation; while she appeared
to listen with the most languid indifference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Young Lord Nelthorpe, one of their nearest
neighbours at Arden, now approached our party.
Jane had noticed him for some time, and, on
first doing so, had coloured deeply. They had
not met before since their arrival in town. He
came up to our party, was very polite, and even
friendly, but not quite as cordial as might have
been expected. He conversed with Lady Arden
for a little time. Music commenced, he made
a slight bow, and moving quickly towards a
lady at a little distance, led her to the
quadrille. Jane had been so perfectly certain
that he intended to dance with her, that when
the music began, she had instinctively drawn
her arm half way from within her mother's.
Her disappointment was bitter, and arose from
a feeling much deeper than the mere loss of a
partner for the dance could have excited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>From her earliest childhood she had been in
the habit of hearing her own family speak of
Lord Nelthorpe as a very suitable match.
As children together, they had been quite
little lovers. Public schools and colleges
had broken off this familiarity of intercourse.
He had, however, since arriving at the age of
manhood, often paid her a good deal of attention
in the country, where he had nothing else to do;
and in some of the summer evening walks of the
young people, a declaration had more than once
seemed to tremble on his lips; still nothing decided
had passed; and poor Jane's heart had
been given away, some couple of years before she
had begun to doubt the sincerity of his attachment,
or the certainty of their future union.
And why was Jane mistaken? Because, society
being artificially constituted, the language of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
nature cannot explain the motives which govern
its members; nor our own feelings, till we too
become sophisticated, teach us to calculate upon
those of others.</p>

<p>The attention of Alfred was just at this moment
attracted by the appearance of the younger
of two ladies, who were standing at a little distance.
They were evidently, from their striking
resemblance, mother and daughter. The stature
of both was rather above the middle height;
that of the elder, from its queen-like carriage,
and its being a little disposed to embonpoint,
had a strikingly imposing and majestic effect;
while that of the younger, though perfectly
formed and beautifully rounded, was so delicate
in its proportions, and so timid in its air,
as to require comparison to convince the eye
that the actual elevation was the same. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
features of both were so regular, that it would
be impossible for the scrutiny of the nicest artist,
to discover a defect; but those of the elder were
of a lustrous, conspicuous white, as though
chiseled in Parian marble; those of the younger
of a stainless transparency, as if modelled in the
purest wax; the lips only of both were of a
lively red; those of the elder, perhaps, a little
too thin, but boasting the glossy scarlet of the
coral; while those of the younger, full and bewitching
in their expression, were of the tender
tint of the rose's ambrosial centre. The hair,
eye-brows, and eye-lashes of both were absolute
jet; but while the firm braiding of the elder
lady's tresses betrayed the usual defect of black
hair&mdash;strength of texture&mdash;the raven ringlets of
the younger rivalled the flaxen locks of childhood
in their silken softness. The line of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
eye-brow, too, was the most delicately penciled,
and her eye-lashes the longest, or they seemed
so, her eyes being cast down; while those of
the elder lady were raised and fully visible.
They were dark, large, and brilliant; but the
supercilious vanity with which they moved
slowly round, courting the universal admiration
they drew towards them, without once shrinking
from its glare, made it impossible for their
lustre, splendid as it was, to reach any heart.</p>

<p>Alfred observed an elderly gentleman with
whom he was acquainted join the two ladies,
and converse for a time with the air of an old
intimate of the elder. As soon as he quitted
them Alfred joined him; and with as much circumlocution,
preparation, and management, as
though he had in view nothing less than the
place of prime minister, demanded if he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
venture to introduce him to his fair friends, as a
candidate for the hand of the younger lady for the
next quadrille. Nothing could be easier: Lord
Darlingford was intimate with the parties;
accordingly, he presented our hero to Lady
Palliser and her daughter, Lady Caroline Montague.</p>

<p>The eyes of the latter were, at the moment of
introduction, of necessity lifted to Alfred's face.
In colour, size, and liquid lustre they resembled
her mother's; but oh, how unlike were they in
their mild, beseeching expression; and in the
tremulous movement of the lids; which, as if
weighed down by their sable veil of silken lashes,
hastened again to overshadow them. The transparent
cheek too, at the same instant that the
eyes were raised, had been visited by a deep
blush; gifting, though but for a fleeting instant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
this beautiful, this almost too unearthly being
with the warm glow of life.</p>

<p>The effect on Alfred of the momentary vision
was decisive of his fate.</p>

<p>During the dance, to which this introduction
led, the snatches of most exquisite pleasure experienced
by our hero were when, by directly
addressing his partner, he could again induce
her to look up. On each such occasion, the
beseeching expression already described, excited,
despite the cooler suggestions of reason, a
feeling as though the gentle appeal were addressed
to him in particular. What was there
so entreated that he would not have undertaken?
The most difficult feats of ancient chivalry, nay,
the impossibilities of necromancy itself, would
have seemed tasks of easy performance in such
a cause! His beautiful partner said very little;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
yet, from her general demeanour, and the fluttering
frequency with which her changing colour
came and went, it might be inferred that her
reserve was neither that of haughtiness, nor of cold
calculation, but rather an excess of almost painful
timidity. This reserve, however, did not affect her
performance of the quadrille, which was perfect;
it was the harmony of motion realized. The
absolute accordance was such that it seemed to
be the influence of the musical sounds on the
undulating air, which wafted the light form,
"like the thistle-down floating on the breeze,"
through each evolution of the dance. Or when
called upon to quit her original position in the
quadrille for a few seconds and again return to
it, such was the quiet grace with which she executed
the task, that it seemed as though the delicate
vision, fading away like Scott's White Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of the Mist, had but ceased for a moment to be
visible, and, in a moment more, again became
palpable to sight.</p>

<p>From time to time she looked at Lady Palliser;
not, however, as though it were there she
sought a refuge; for, on the contrary, there was
an indescribable something in the manner of the
glance, which conveyed the idea that her ladyship
was the principal object of her daughter's
fears. Yet again, the moment the quadrille
was concluded, Lady Caroline expressed a
wish to rejoin her mother. Lady Palliser received
our hero with a coldness that very soon
made him feel obliged to take himself off. At
once captivated and mortified, he felt disinclined
to dance any more, and rather disposed to indulge
in reveries, while pursuing with his eyes
the form of his new acquaintance through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
moving crowd. Instead, however, of reclining
indolently on a sofa, or lounging about with
other men, he devoted himself, in the most
amiable manner possible, to his mother and sisters
for the remainder of the evening; and though
they found him somewhat deaf, performed, when
they did make him hear, any little service they
required of him with great alacrity. Notwithstanding
which, ere the evening was over, each
of his sisters had severally informed him that he
was already in love. Such secrets are generally
discovered by others before they are known to
the parties themselves.</p>

<p>A friend of Lady Arden's, forgetful that her
ladyship objected on principle to all younger
sons, <i>except her own</i>, had introduced Henry
Lindsey to Louisa. Her exquisite beauty dazzled
and delighted him, while her gratified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
vanity, at the enthusiasm of his admiration,
made her manner so encouraging, that he believed
himself well received, and gave himself
up to hopes and feelings destined to cost him
many a bitter pang.</p>

<p>Lord Darlingford, though a widower and a
man, by his own account upwards of fifty, was
much disposed, on the strength of his rank, to
be a serious admirer of Jane Arden. This
evening he found himself better received than
usual; he did not deem it necessary to make a
fool of himself by dancing, but was sitting
apart with the lady, conversing very earnestly,
and was just beginning to weigh the propriety
of availing himself of so favourable an opportunity
for making her an offer of marriage,
when Lord Nelthorpe came up and asked her
to dance. The moment before she had deter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>mined,
if he did do so at this late period of the
evening, to reject his offer. As soon, however,
as he approached, and preferred his request, her
spirited resolve vanished: with one of her
sweetest smiles she rose and took his arm, and
in the flurry of her spirits, forgetting to make
even a parting bow to poor Lord Darlingford,
left him sitting alone, looking what he was,
quite forsaken, and cursing himself for an old
fool.</p>

<p>Lord Nelthorpe now took pains to be particularly
agreeable, and either from vanity or
lingering attachment, was evidently anxious to
discover if he still retained the power he knew
he had long possessed over the feelings of his
fair partner. He made allusions to her late
companion, and half jest, half earnest, ventured
several whispered comments, almost amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>ing
to tender reproaches, watching her countenance
while he did so. As he handed her
into the carriage, he secretly wished, with
something like a sigh, that he had no brothers
and sisters to pay off. She went home in high
spirits.</p>

<p>"I wish, Jane," said Lady Arden, as they
drove from the door, "you would make up your
mind to marry Lord Darlingford."</p>

<p>Jane made no reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning Willoughby confided to
his brother the determination he had come to on
the last evening, of proposing for Lady Anne
Armadale, the daughter of Lord Selby.</p>

<p>He described with great exultation how much
attached the lady had been to a gentleman of
whom her friends disapproved, and whom she
was notwithstanding determined to marry up to
the time he had become his rival; but that he
had not been long in driving the former lover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
from the field, and securing the preference of
the lady.</p>

<p>Alfred, in his anxiety for his brother's happiness,
forgot for the moment his usual dread of
offering advice.</p>

<p>"For heaven sake," he said, "Willoughby,
pause! Be <i>quite</i> certain that you have secured
her real preference!"</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> quite certain," said Willoughby, taking
up his hat impatiently.</p>

<p>"Nay, do not be hasty either with the lady
or with me."</p>

<p>"You think it is impossible for any woman to
prefer me, I suppose. I have, I confess, no
pretensions to be an Adonis," he added with a
sneer, for he knew that Alfred was considered
remarkably handsome; "at the same time all
people's taste are fortunately not alike!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, my dear Willoughby, do not be childish!
Is it not wiser to use a little caution?
Have you no fear of finding yourself, when too
late, the husband of a woman capable of sacrificing
her feelings to her interest?"</p>

<p>Willoughby abruptly quitted the room. He
went directly to Lord Selby's, and in less than an
hour had proposed for, and been accepted by
Lady Anne Armadale.</p>

<p>Unhappily for Willoughby, the slender share
of sense he possessed was not only at all times
hoodwinked by vanity, but in general superseded
in its operations by temper. For if any
friend happened to offer him the slightest advice,
so jealous was he of having it supposed
his judgment required assistance, that, without
waiting to consider if any offence was
intended, he would feel perhaps but a momen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>tary
resentment, yet, while under its dominion,
as the readiest and most appropriate revenge,
would resolve hastily on an opposite line of conduct
to that suggested by his adviser; and having
once so resolved, obstinacy would put its
seal on a determination which in fact had never
been examined by his understanding, while
had there been no interference, he would at
least have considered the subject, and might,
possibly, have come to a just conclusion.</p>

<p>A man of a decidedly superior mind, on the
contrary, having no private misgivings respecting
his own capacity, is always well pleased to
take under consideration any new views of a
subject, which the suggestions of a friend, or
indeed of any one, may present. It is of course
his own judgment which finally decides, but
like a just judge, after first hearing every wit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>ness,
that is to say every argument which can
be brought to bear upon the subject. Acuteness
in prejudging is the boast of the fool.
Discrimination to give its due weight to every
part of the evidence, the privilege of the man
of sense. The fool is always telling you he can
see with half an eye. We would request such
persons to employ in future the whole of both
orbs, and possibly with a vision so extraordinary,
they might be enabled to pierce even to
the bottom of that far-famed well, in which it is
said that truth has hitherto lain hid from the researches
of mankind.</p>

<p>Certainly no claim to merit or distinction can
be more absurd than that which is founded on
the wilfully limited means employed for producing
the desired end.</p>

<p>Excellence, to challenge admiration, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
be excellence in the abstract; while he who
would be even a respectable candidate for the
prize, should use every power that Providence
has given to man, avail himself of every ray of
light that the experience of past ages has elicited,
and bringing all to a focus, pour the concentrated
beam on the path to be explored.</p>

<p>Thus only can each generation hope to gain
some step on the road towards perfection unattained
by its predecessor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Gloucester Villa, the residence of Mr.
Salter, at Cheltenham, was in a state of high
preparation for a dinner to be given to Lady
Flamborough.</p>

<p>Mrs. Johnson had no leisure to assist the
<i>young</i> ladies to dress, they were therefore left
to perform that office for each other.</p>

<p>"By-the-by, I have been so much hurried,
I forgot to tell you," said Grace, "but Lady
Arden is now really coming: Mrs. Dorothea's
maid has been telling Johnson all about it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say it's just talk as usual," said
Miss Salter.</p>

<p>"No, no, it's quite certain now," persisted
her sister, "for Violet Bank is taken for her
ladyship for six months certain, and the adjoining
villa, Jessamine Bower, for another titled
lady; and I daresay they'll be acquainted, so
you see what we've lost!"</p>

<p>"Well, that is really provoking!" exclaimed
Miss Salter. "I wonder would there be any
use in sending her an invitation for this evening?"</p>

<p>"Sending who an invitation?" said Grace.
"Mrs. Dorothea do you mean? Oh, quite ridiculous
at this late hour; and after leaving her
out of the ball too!"</p>

<p>"I know all that," replied Miss Salter;
"but let me see, I'll write her a long apology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
about having sent a card for our ball to her old
lodging in mistake! and for the short notice I'll
say, that I know she likes friendly invitations
better than formal ones, and that our party
this evening is to be so particularly select,
just what I know she likes; and then I'll
give a list of the titles, and that I think will
decide her, even if she does see through the
excuses."</p>

<p>Accordingly Miss Salter, in great triumph at
her own diplomatic abilities, wrote and dispatched
her note.</p>

<p>"After all," she added, as she resumed her
toilette, "these are sorrowful rejoicings for us,
for I suppose with this fine lady coming to dinner,
and being so gracious, and all that, she
means to marry my father; and if she does,
though to be sure it'ill bring fine acquaintance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
I suppose, but will it bring us husbands?&mdash;on
the contrary, if it gets abroad that we're not to
have a shilling&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll have but a poor chance, I'm afraid,"
interrupted Grace.</p>

<p>"But I'll tell you what I have done to endeavour
to obviate that," said her sister; "I
have been telling Johnson, and I have told her
too that she may tell it where she pleases,
for it's no harm that the truth should be
known, that our mother's fortune was a hundred
thousand pounds, and was so settled
upon us that my father can't keep it from us;
and she has begun already with Sir William
Orm's man, and he has told his master, and Sir
William is full of it; so we shall see how he
behaves to-day."</p>

<p>"But what a shocking lie!" said Grace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lie! Nonsense!" replied her sister, "Who
tells the truth, I'd be glad to know?"</p>

<p>Here the answer to the note interrupted the
conversation. It was of course a formal apology.
Mrs. Dorothea had not been at a loss
to see through the motives of her <i>friends</i> the
Salters.</p>

<p>The <i>young</i> ladies now descended to the drawing-room,
where Mr. Salter was already standing
at a window, in high dress; with the bright
white, angular points of a fresh put on collar,
contrasting finely with the shining ruby of his
cheeks. A carriage with a coronet drove up
to the door; bless me, how fine! thought the
Misses Salter; it was almost enough to reconcile
their father's marrying again.</p>

<p>Lady Flamborough was announced. Her
ladyship entered; her round, fat, rosy face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
smiling in a round wreath of red roses. Her
dress, a colour de rose satin, her ornaments,
necklace and earrings of pink topaz.</p>

<p>The broad daylight, or rather sunshine, of
the first day in May, in weather unusually fine,
and even hot for the season, in a three windowed,
south-west drawing room, at six o'clock,
did ample justice to the glow of her ladyship's
appearance, which nothing less than the entrance,
immediately after, of Lady Whaleworthy,
in a crimson velvet, could have at all subdued.</p>

<p>Lady Shawbridge arrived next. Her dress was
a gold coloured velvet, and gold tissue turban,
the wide circumference of which displayed the
fiery countenance hinted at by Mrs. Dorothea
to great advantage. Indeed the whole assembly
was of a fiery order; although being, as
we have said, hot weather, there was no oc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>casion
for fire. But the very furniture of the
room, unluckily for the day and aspect, was
crimson, while in addition to the red and reddish
countenances already enumerated, Miss Salter's
face, on all warm occasions like the present, was
much too apt to emulate the glow of her father's.
While even poor Miss Grace, though in general,
from hardness and thinness, a chilly object, was
subject with peculiar provocation, to a dullish
red knob, like a winter cherry, just at the end
of her nose.</p>

<p>The rest of the party having arrived, and
among them Sir William Orm, Sir James Lindsey,
Sir Francis Brierton, and the general, dinner
was announced. Mr. Salter gave his arm to
Lady Flamborough, and leading the way, was
followed by the rest of the company, to the
dining-room; which, having the same aspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
as the drawing-room, and being, besides
over the kitchen, was by no means calculated
to cool the already heated guests. The two
turtles, we mean Mr. Salter and Lady Flamborough,
every way so well <i>entitled</i> to the <i>title</i>,
being in their forms turtles, and in their present
dispositions towards each other turtle doves,
took their loving seats side by side, opposite
to the turtle-soup, at the head of the table.
(Men who have no wives of course head their
own tables.)</p>

<p>The dinner having been entirely provided at
so much a-head, by a pastrycook, who was to
remove its remains, was of course only too good,
we mean too fine, too much ornamented, too
technical; in fact the display of each course resembled
more a confectioner's counter than a
gentleman's table. Every thing, in short, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
so befrosted, and so beglazed, that if one had
been at all absent, one might have put one's
hand in one's pocket, and asked what was to pay.</p>

<p>It is an acknowledged fact, that to act the
gentleman is impossible. It is equally impossible
for people, though possessed of the purse
of Fortunatus, to ape successfully, on special
occasions, a style of living not habitual to
them.</p>

<p>We hope we have not cooled the turtle-soup
by our digression. Poor Mr. Salter, instead of
quietly conveying ladles of soup to soup-plates,
till the demand ceased, was most unnecessarily
prolonging his own labours, and delaying the
progress of the feast, by deliberately inquiring
of every several member of the assembly by
name, if they chose turtle-soup, and poising the
while, his insignia of office over the tureen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
till their ear caught the question and his the
reply.</p>

<p>By the time similar rites had been performed
over every steaming remove, it may be believed
that the countenance of our host had lost nothing
of its brilliancy. During the dessert he had
more leisure to turn its lustre, adorned with
smiles, on his fair companion; whose uplifted
eyes languishingly met his, till there wanted but
the pipe to make the pair an excellent study for
a painter of the Dutch school. The attitude too,
leaning back at their ease in their chairs, so
favourably displayed their forms, that the couple
in this particular very much resembled a <i>pair
of globes</i>; though we must confess that, except
in courtesy to the lady, we should not have been
disposed to designate either the celestial.</p>

<p>Sir William Orm, who had handed in Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Salter, was descanting with much feeling on
the interested motives which governed the matrimonial
views of but too many men in the
world, and declaring that such must ever be
secondary considerations with him. Miss Salter
confessed that amiable sentiments like his were
very rare now a days, and consequently the
more to be admired. On the opposite side, Sir
James Lindsey was giggling with silly self-satisfaction,
as he sat receiving the assiduous
attentions and pointed compliments of Miss
Grace. While Lady Shawbridge was remarking
aside to Sir Matthias Whaleworthy, that Lady
Flamborough's youthful airs were quite disgusting;
and Sir Matthias in return, made some
comments on Mr. Salter's dancing, which
sounded very ungrateful, proceeding from lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
which had just finished a <i>second</i> plate of the
man's turtle-soup.</p>

<p>Lady Whaleworthy, good soul, was telling
Sir Henry Shawbridge one of the long stories
about herself, her father and mother, brothers
and sisters, husband, children, and servants,
which she inflicted on all who had the misfortune
to sit near, and the patience to listen to
her.</p>

<p>Ere the ladies left the dining-room, the now
completely enamoured Mr. Salter had determined,
that in the course of the evening he would
take a sly opportunity of making Lady Flamborough
an offer of his heart and hand. Alas!
how vain are human resolves, when we know
not what an hour or at most an hour and
a half may bring forth; for it could not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
exceeded that time, when the gentlemen followed
the ladies to the drawing-room, and yet Mr.
Salter's visual organs by some process, possibly
connected with a certain series of toasts, which
despite of fashion, he might have felt it his
duty to propose, had in that short period undergone
such an extraordinary change, that when
he approached what ought to have been the
<i>sole</i> object of his affections, he beheld as it were
two Lady Flamboroughs, sitting, or rather attempting
to sit, on the same chair! He gazed
in utter amazement, and strove to concentrate
the powers of sight: for a second the mysterious
vision amalgamated, and was but one! again,
however, it glided asunder, and became two!
nor did this happen but once, so as to leave any
room for doubt or mistake, on the contrary, while
our astonished host still stood staring, the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>traordinary
process was frequently repeated.
Nay, once, as lured by the smiles of the fair
shadow nearest him, he ventured to address
some complimentary remark to its ear in particular,
it slid away as if for refuge behind its
representative, and immediately after popped in
view on the other side!</p>

<p>Whether it is that supernatural appearances
have a tendency to awe the passions into stillness,
or whether this glaring infringement on the
classical laws of unity, by dividing, destroyed
the interest; or whether possibly, some vague
dread of being betrayed unconsciously into the
sin of bigamy, might have presented itself to
the imagination of Mr. Salter, we have not
philosophical lore nor critical acumen sufficient
to decide; we can only speak to the effect,
which was, that Mr. Salter, instead of finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
with this double provocation a double share of
love inundating his heart and overflowing his
lips, was struck perfectly mute, and continued
so for the remainder of the evening.</p>

<p>So much for lovers continuing their libations
at Bacchus' shrine until they see double.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>"Well, there is nothing like getting into
<i>select</i> society after all!" said Miss Salter to her
sister, when they had retired for the night.
"Who would have thought, six months ago, of
both of us having baronets for lovers? I dare
say you are right, Grace, and that this marriage
of my father's (for I suppose now it will take
place), is the best thing that could have happened
for us. And I know, I'm determined
when I'm married to Sir William Orm (and he
has gone great lengths, I assure you), that I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
visit none but titled people. And tell me, how
did you and Sir James get on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, delightfully!" answered her sister, "he
asked me if I thought him very handsome; and of
course I said I did; and then he laughed so. And
then he asked me if I thought the silk of his
waistcoat a pretty pattern; and I said I did;
and he told me a lady chose it for him. And
he asked me if I was inclined to be jealous; and
I said if I thought he had any regard for me, I'd
be jealous of every lady that looked at him; and
he said, 'would you indeed?' and laughed again.
And he asked me if I admired his dancing as
much as most people did, for that he was thought
a first rate dancer; and I said that nobody could
help admiring his dancing. And he asked me
if I could think what in the world it was that
made so many young ladies refuse to dance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
with him; and I said it was, to be sure, because
he danced so well that they were afraid it would
make their own bad dancing the more noticed.
'And do you really think so?' said he, laughing
again. And so, at last, only think! he asked
me if I'd like very much to be my lady! and I
said I should of all things. And so then he
laughed, and said he could make any body a
lady he chose."</p>

<p>"And I hope you said you wished he'd make
you one," interrupted her sister.</p>

<p>"Why I thought of it," replied Miss Grace,
"but I was afraid people would hear me; if we
had been quite by ourselves, I would have
said it."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" exclaimed Miss Salter.
"If you can get to be my lady, and have fifteen
thousand a-year at your command, I think you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
can afford to defy people's comments about how
you came by it! You said, the other day, that
if luck knocked once at your door, it shouldn't
have to knock twice. I'm sure it knocked then,
with a vengeance, and such a knock as comes
to the doors of but few, I can tell you; and you
the fool not to answer it. It's such as you'll
never hear again, with your little ugly black-a-moor
face. And when you had the good fortune
to get hold of a fool that didn't know the difference,
if you dosed his draught with flattery
enough, you should have said or done anything
to please him, blockhead that you are."</p>

<p>"You needn't be so abusive, Eliza," said poor
Grace, almost whimpering, "I'm sure I thought
I was barefaced enough, this time, to please you."</p>

<p>"Such stuff, with your mock modesty," interrupted
Miss Salter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"And as for a black face, it's as good as a
red one, any day," continued Grace, "and rather
<i>genteeler</i> for that matter," she added, "since
you're grown so mighty fond of gentility."</p>

<p>Miss Salter's rage now knew no bounds, and
consequently became so coarse and disgusting
in its manifestation, that we shall forbear any
further representation of the scene.</p>

<p>Vulgar people are bad enough in good humour.
Propitious fate deliver us from them when they
are out of temper!</p>

<p>Before proceeding further with our history,
we may as well take the present opportunity of
sketching slightly the origin of this same titled
personage, by a connection with whom the
Misses Salter expected to gain so much consequence.
Lady Flamborough was the only child
of an hotel-keeper, who, in his hospitable calling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
had amassed enormous wealth. He had not
always, however, been the great man, even in
his own line, which he ultimately became. His
daughter, therefore, to the age of five or six,
was brought up, literally running about in a
very minor establishment, little better, in short,
than a road-side posting-house; and, being a
pretty, rosy, fat child, had, up to that age, been
the pet and plaything, not only of her father,
(she had no mother living), but of every waiter
and hostler in and about the house. And often
had she sat on her father's knee, while he drank
his ale in the bar, and, when the jest and the
tale went round, which were, as yet, to the ear
of the child, a foreign tongue, laughed merrily
for very glee at seeing others laugh. But alas!
amid the sounds and sights of scenes like these,
native delicacy, even at this early age, was lost.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
For callousness is not so much a wrong bias
given, as a class of feelings, out of which some
of the most valuable traits of character are hereafter
to be formed, destroyed; and if the material
be gone, how can the superstructure be
raised?</p>

<p>The child was, after this, sent to expensive
boarding-schools, and as her father's fortunes
rose, given every possible accomplishment. In
these, and her being very pretty, Mr. * * * *,
afterwards Lord Flamborough, but then a
younger brother, and of course poor, found some
apology for overlooking the lady's want of birth,
and appropriating her immense wealth, which
was his true object.</p>

<p>Soon after his marriage, his brother died, and
he succeeded to the title and estates; and now,
bitterly repenting his ill-assorted union, behaved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
with neglect, and even contempt, towards his
wife. Upon which the lady, partly out of revenge,
and partly out of levity, gave a favourable
reception to the addresses of a lover in no
very exalted sphere of life.</p>

<p>Proceedings were immediately instituted to
obtain legal redress; but before the divorce had
passed the house, his lordship, who had previously
been in a bad state of health, chanced
to die.</p>

<p>Lady Flamborough, therefore, though of
course banished from all tolerable society, still continued
to be Lady Flamborough, and to enjoy a
handsome jointure. On her total expulsion
from the set among whom her marriage had, for
a time, given her a place, she descended till she
found her level among that, rationally speaking,
only disreputable class, made up of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
who have lost caste by their own wilful departures
from principle, and those who are contemptible
enough to be willing to associate with
vice, for the love of the <i>tarnished tinsel</i> which
once was rank; forgetful that titles and honours
were first invented as badges of the virtuous or
heroic deeds of those on whom they were bestowed;
that only as such they have any meaning;
and that, when borne by the vicious, they
become, in a peculiar degree, objects for the
finger of scorn to point at, and seem to claim,
as their especial privilege, the contempt and
derision of mankind.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'Tis phrase absurd to call a villain great."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Titles are attainted for high treason, why
should they not be so for every treason against
good morals? Are not good morals as essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
to the well-being of the community as good
Government?</p>

<p>Nay, what is Government? Power to enforce
moral order. Why then should not a sin
against the end be visited as severely as a sin
against the means?</p>

<p>Are men, whose vices invade the peace of the
domestic hearth, and sunder the sacred ties of
life,&mdash;or men who court luxury in foreign climes,
while evading the payment of their just debts
at home; consigning the while industrious
tradesmen and their helpless families to ruin;&mdash;are
men, in short, who are no longer men of
honour, to be still misnamed <i>noble men</i>? Is it
not the natural tendency of such misnomers to
bring nobility into contempt? And is not this
an injustice to the truly <i>noble</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Are the vicious to be allowed to sully honours
till the honourable cannot wear them?</p>

<p>Nobility would indeed be beautiful were it a
guarantee of virtue! titles would indeed be
honours, if the men who bore them must be
pure! And if the certainty that those titles for
ages had existed in that family, were thus an
assurance that morality for centuries had not
been sinned against in that house, then indeed,
would rank be nobility. Let us not be misunderstood:
let us not be supposed to mean
that men of rank are more likely to offend
against the laws of morality than other men; on
the contrary, education and circumstances ought
to render them less so: we simply assert, that
when they do so offend, such offence ought to
degrade them from their rank as <i>noble men</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>How glorious would be that land that first
enacted such a law! how worthy its monarch
of that greatest of his titles, "Defender of the
Faith!" For what is this faith? Religion!
and the author of Religion has defined it thus:</p>

<p>"True religion and undefiled, before God and
the Father is this: to visit the fatherless and
widows in their affliction, and keep himself unspotted
from the world."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>Mrs. Dorothea had been so busy all day,
changing her lodgings again, that she had
hardly had time to ask Sarah a word about the
Salters' dinner-party.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, we must remark,
that she had moved to a furnished house, not to
a mere lodging; for she was determined to make
an exertion, while the Ardens were in Cheltenham,
live how she might the rest of the year,
having a great horror of living like a poor
relation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Most people have a particular objection to
seeming to be what they really are.</p>

<p>Indeed Lady Arden had written most kindly
to Mrs. Dorothea, inviting her to spend the
time they should be at Cheltenham with them.
Had the expense of a house or lodging been no
object to Aunt Dorothea, she would gladly have
availed herself of this invitation for the pleasure
of the thing; but the arrangement would have
been so very convenient, that her <i>pride</i> took the
alarm, and would not suffer her to accept the
offer. In her father's life time, as a daughter of
the then head of the family, she had acquired
notions of her own consequence, which became
a painful incumbrance from the moment her circumstances
underwent that violent revolution
to which those of the daughters of the proudest
and most ancient families are peculiarly liable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pride</i> in any situation is a moral disease,
which it would be highly desirable to see for
ever banished from the world! but <i>pride</i>, when
complicated with poverty, is apt to render the
unhappy sufferer not only always very uncomfortable,
but often very ridiculous. Added to
which, it must ever be impossible for the heart
that harbours <i>pride</i> to know contentment.</p>

<p>At present, however, Mrs. Dorothea was quite
delighted. The house she had taken for six
months certain for Lady Arden, though designated
by the rural title of Violet Bank, was a
splendid mansion. The one she had taken for
herself for the same period, was both pretty and
agreeably situated; it was accommodated with a
cook, or maid of all work, who was taken with
it as a part of the furniture. Mrs. Dorothea had
also hired a footman for the great occasion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
put him into livery; so that with Sarah, her own
maid, she had now, for a single lady, quite a respectable
little establishment, and could look
forward to returning the evening entertainments,
at least of her relations, on something of
an independent footing. Dinners of course she
could not give, nor need she accept them; she
did not care what she eat. She certainly liked
the best society, and that she should now have,
without laying herself under obligations to any
one. For, much as she liked Lady Arden, (one
whom no one could help liking, she was so truly
amiable,) she could not forget that her ladyship
was a stranger in blood, from whom, consequently,
an <i>Arden</i> could not receive even a
courtesy without requital.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dorothea was so glad too, as she told
Sarah, while she stood in the centre of her new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
drawing-room, looking round her, to get out of
that horrid place where she had been for the
last two months, sitting every evening on those
tiresome little chairs, for, as Sarah had prophesied,
her landlady had never given her the sofa,
nor put the drops to the chimney-light, nor even
got a key for the chiffonier. Then, the woman
of the house could not or would not afford a
decent servant, so that the cooking was shocking,
and the attendance wretched; and then the
oven of the bakehouse next door she found out
at last was just on the other side of the one
brick thin wall, against which her bed stood, so
that she had been nearly baked to death, and
had been losing her health without knowing
why. To be sure the carpet looked respectable,
but then the lodging had no other recommendation,
as in addition to its many dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>comforts, it had
proved one way or other very
expensive; for mistaking the heat and restlessness
she felt at nights for the consequences of
the lassitude and want of appetite of which they
were in fact the cause; she had got frightened
about herself, and had called in doctor after
doctor, and taken ever so much medicine in
vain, till at last happening to go in next door to
correct an error in her baker's bill, in which she
had been charged with all the bread supplied to
her landlady, she became acquainted with the
geography of the premises, and so discovered
the whole mystery. Then being without a key
to the chiffonier too, made a great difference in
the groceries, though having no proof of the
fact, it would not do to say so. This might
have brought down the lawyers upon her; then
indeed would the cup of her afflictions have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
been full. Poor Aunt Dorothea felt almost restored
to the days of her youth by the comparative
comforts which now surrounded her. She
moved into her regular dining-room when her
dinner was ready, and was there decently and
respectfully attended by her own footman in
livery. There was a sideboard, and her few
articles of plate were arranged upon it, and
things looked orderly and comfortable; it was
enough to give one an appetite, and made her
boiled chicken and quarter of a hundred of
asparagus seem a dinner for an emperor. Instead
of dining in the comfortless scramble she
used to do, in her haste to send the tray out of
the drawing-room lest some one should come
in, she now ate as slowly as possible to prolong
the gratifying sense of dignity which accompanied
the ceremony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>The very next day the Misses Salter had the
impudence to call, and the new footman not
being in the family secrets, admitted them.</p>

<p>On their entrance Aunt Dorothea looked her
astonishment with great dignity.</p>

<p>"What a sweet situation," exclaimed Miss
Salter.</p>

<p>"What a charming house," said Miss Grace.
Mrs. Dorothea bowed.</p>

<p>"How fortunate we were in finding you at
home," said Miss Salter.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, very fortunate indeed!" added Miss
Grace. Mrs. Dorothea bowed again.</p>

<p>"How sorry we were you could not come to
us last night," said Miss Salter, "we had such
a <i>select</i> party, just what you would have liked."</p>

<p>"Yes, just what you would have liked,"
echoed Miss Grace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope we shall be more fortunate the next
time," said Miss Salter. "We shall have a
great many of those agreeable <i>select</i> parties just
now. Our <i>particular friend</i>, Lady Flamborough,
you see, and our <i>particular friend</i>, Lady Whaleworthy,
and our <i>particular friend</i>, Lady Shawbridge,
and all that pleasant set being here just
now, naturally induces one to see a great deal
of company. Then there are such delightful
young men here at present, and that you know
always makes parties pleasant, there's <i>our friend</i>,
Sir William Orm, <i>such</i> an elegant fashionable
young man."</p>

<p>"And Sir James Lindsey," observed Miss
Grace, "an old baronet, with fifteen thousand
a-year."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Salter, "such an agreeable
good tempered little man, so affable and unas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>suming.
And there is General Powel too, in
short we quite abound in <i>nice young</i> men. And
I hope," added Miss Salter, with an air of great
friendship, "that we shall soon and often have
the pleasure of seeing you, Mrs. Arden."</p>

<p>"You are very obliging," replied Mrs. Dorothea,
bowing gravely, "but my arrangements
will for some considerable time be controlled
entirely by those of my sister, Lady Arden, and
her family, with whom I shall consider myself
engaged, either at home or abroad, every day
during their stay."</p>

<p>"So you expect Lady Arden," said Miss
Salter, with well affected surprise. "Dear me,
I'm sure we should be most happy to pay attention
to any friend of yours."</p>

<p>"You are very obliging," observed Mrs.
Dorothea, with if possible increasing stiffness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
"but Lady Arden does not mean to extend her
acquaintance."</p>

<p>The discomforted Misses Salter finding lingering
and last words useless, at length took
their departure.</p>

<p>The Ardens dined on the road, but arrived
in time to take tea with Aunt Dorothea. The
weather was beautiful; the rural appearance
of the little villa, situated among the plantations
and pleasure grounds of the public walks, its
own miniature lawn and veranda, adorned with
flowers and flowering shrubs, and garlanded
with roses as if for a festival, the fine trees of
the Old-Well-Walk in view, and bands of music,
as if hid in every grove, sending forth on each
breeze some strain of melody, all seemed delightful
and refreshing to people just escaped
from the heat and fatigue of London. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the large and joyous looking family party, some
seated within the open glass door, some standing
in the veranda, some straying on the fresh
mown turf of the little lawn, formed a picture
of social felicity quite delightful to the usually
solitary Aunt Dorothea; to whom the idea of
the party being not only her near relatives,
but also her guests, was altogether so pleasing
that she had not been as happy for many years.
To her kind heart must be ascribed the chief of
the pleasure she experienced; if, however, there
was a slight admixture of gratified vanity we
cannot be surprised, when we consider that a
pretty comfortable house of her own, in which
to receive her friends, was to her so great a
novelty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>So fond is youth of novelty, that Alfred and
his sisters, though fresh from all the gaieties a
London season has to offer, were quite impatient,
the very morning after their arrival, to visit the
public walks, of which they had had peeps the
evening before from Aunt Dorothea's veranda.
They had been told that about seven was the
hour. Accordingly, as it was a fine sunny morning,
the girls were all up soon after six. They
had been told too, that notwithstanding the
hour, it was usual to be extremely fine; but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
this their habits of good taste were too inveterate;
they equipped themselves therefore
in quite close bonnets, and having roused and
enlisted the goodnatured Alfred, set off for
Mrs. Dorothea's, Lady Arden having by an arrangement
of the evening before, committed
the young people to the charge of their aunt,
knowing that she should be too much fatigued
herself after her journey to rise so early.</p>

<p>Aunt Dorothea was quite ready. She was
too happy in feeling herself necessary to her
nieces, too happy in having the charge of them,
too justly proud of them, proud of their beauty,
and all their many attractions and recommendations,
to feel anything like laziness, this first
morning that she was to show, not only the
walks to them, but them to the walks.</p>

<p>Thither then they proceeded immediately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
guided through each shady maze, as in the play
called <i>Magic Music</i>, in which the sounds become
louder to denote nearness to the object of
pursuit. So did the swelling notes of the band
grow on the ear as they approached the immediate
spot, which it is fashion's whim to
throng as closely as any crowded assembly-room,
while all around is comparative solitude.</p>

<p>Here all-kind Aunt Dorothea's proud anticipations
were fully answered by the sensation
her nieces produced; every eye was turned towards
them, and in ten minutes after their first
appearance all the company who sat on the
benches on either side the walk had asked each
other who they were; the mammas who had
daughters, and the <i>young</i> ladies who were <i>not
young</i>, decided that they were not the style of
beauty they admired, while the very young girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and all the men, had pronounced them the loveliest
creatures they had ever beheld. As for
the mothers who had sons, they prudently suspended
their judgments till they should hear
what fortunes the Miss Ardens were likely to
have.</p>

<p>Our party were joined instantly by Henry
Lindsey. He had ascertained their movements
from themselves, and quitted town when they
did to be in Cheltenham before them. He was
at Louisa's side in a moment, and was received
with a blush and a smile which, though produced
in part at least by gratified vanity, seemed
to his generous nature all he could desire of
encouragement. He was of course introduced
to Aunt Dorothea, who, until she found out
that he was a younger brother, was quite delighted
with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>The Arden party now took advantage of
vacant seats which presented themselves, and
for a time became in their turn spectators of
the moving crowd.</p>

<p>Soon after which, announced by noise, and
with many coloured streamers flying, the fleet
of the Salters, and their <i>select</i> friends hove in
sight.</p>

<p>There was in the first place Mr. Salter, with
a white hat on, which duly set off by contrast,
that true secret for producing effect, a countenance,
the hue of which we flatter ourselves
we need not again describe. Lady Flamborough
embellished his arm; her head thrown back,
and adorned by a pink crape hat and feathers,
her eyes raised, and practising their most becoming
roll, her complexion heightened by the
heat of the weather and the long walk up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
through the Sherbourn. Not that her dress was
oppressive, on the contrary, it was light enough
in all conscience, consisting of the softest India
muslin, trimmed with superfine Mechlin lace,
and ornamented at the neck, and at the wrists
round the top, and round the bottom, down the
sleeves, and down the front, with ties, bows, and
ends innumerable, of pink ribbon, while a broad
long sash of the same encircled the waist, tied
behind in dancing-school fashion. The dress
was made nearly as low round the bust as a
dinner costume, while what shelter there was
to compensate for this was derived from the
long pendant white gauze-ribbon strings, and
deep blond-lace edge of the hat, with merely a
slight pink gauze-scarf, scarcely wider or longer
than the said strings.</p>

<p>The next in the line (as it approached cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>ing
the walk abreast), was Lady Whaleworthy,
defying hot weather and sunshine in a crimson
velvet pelisse. It was a thing which, as she
told her own maid when putting it on, had cost
too much money to be ever either out of season
or out of fashion: it was only your dabs of
things which every body could have that were
sure to go out again before you could turn yourself
round in them, so that there was no saving
in the end. "I always <i>tells</i> Sir Matthias that
a right good article, cost what it will at the
first, is sure to be the cheapest in the long
run."</p>

<p>Poor Lady Whaleworthy! a crimson-velvet
pelisse had been the dream of her youth when
she did not think she should ever possess such
a treasure! and still such the hold of early impressions
in a crimson-velvet pelisse was con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>centrated her
ladyship's notions of the <i>ne plus
ultra</i> of magnificence. Next came little Sir
James, fantastically fine, with a lilac figured silk
waistcoat, as many gold chains as a lady, and a
glaring brooch, the gift of Miss Grace Salter,
and taken for the purpose of being so bestowed
from her own dress, and with her own brown
hands transferred to the breast of his open-work-fronted
and diamond buttoned inner garment;
while the little man, during the whole
performance of the flattering operation, had
laughed almost hysterically.</p>

<p>Three titles were very well to muster for a
morning walk; so next came the Misses Salter
themselves. They never dressed alike, having
each their own notion of the colours that became
them. In shape, however, both their hats
had been made by the same pattern, borrowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
for the purpose from Lady Flamborough's. Miss
Salter's was of yellow crape, Sir William Orm
having been his own jockey at a late race, and
rode in a yellow jacket; while Miss Grace's, in
compliment to Sir James's waistcoat was lilac;
both, of course, flaunted with feathers, blond,
and streaming strings, and had artificial flowers
stuck in the inside. Nor had such a show of
beauty and fashion been a mere lucky hit; the
Misses Salter, on quitting Mrs. Dorothea's, had
fully weighed the subject, and resolved to show
the Ardens, who might else be prejudiced against
them, that they were not people to be looked
down upon; they had gone to infinite pains in
making their arrangements.</p>

<p>Alas! little did they think that this very morning
was marked in the book of fate to cost them
both their lovers: they, too, who had none to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
spare. But unhappily ladies so situated are so
fond of showing off a supposed conquest&mdash;so
fond of being suspected of being about to be
married, that in their haste to be congratulated,
they too often cast away all cause for gratulation;
and by the noise they raise themselves, put
a man on his guard before he is above half
caught, whom they might perhaps have secured,
had they been satisfied to delay their triumph,
and keep him nodding at the home fireside till
they had quietly netted him round. We speak of
course only of ladies in <i>distress</i>, like the Misses
Salter. The lovely sisters of Arden, on the contrary,
so far from being under the necessity of
laying snares for lovers, found them at their feet
wherever they went; the only difficulty was to
select from among them such as might both
please themselves, and come up to their mamma's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and brother's ideas of matches suitable to their
family consequence. We left our party seated
on one of the benches, which, as we have already
stated, were ranged on either side this favourite
portion of the walk. The eye of Sir James, as
he passed with the Salters, was instantly caught
by the extreme loveliness of the beautiful sisters.
For the poor little man, though he had neither
sense nor judgment to direct him in the formation
of any thing approaching to an opinion, was
not without some of the natural elements of
taste, and was especially a great admirer of
beauty: it dazzled and delighted him, as new and
splendid toys would a child; and it was much
that he had been taught to say, like the good
child, "I'll only look!" for he would often stand
with his hands behind his back, as if the attitude
were intended to keep them out of the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of temptation, and to stare at strangers whose
appearance happened to strike him, till people
would be first offended, and finally guess the
truth, that poor Sir James was silly.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, seeing his brother
with the party which had drawn his attention,
he joined him instantly; and even while speaking
to him, as well as for some time after, eagerly
passed his eyes again and again along the row
of ladies, till they were finally fixed by the peculiar
lustre of Louisa's beauty.</p>

<p>Henry now introduced his brother, and the
party rose to renew their walk. Sir James attached
himself to them entirely, and contrived,
too, to make a good position next to Louisa,
whose appetite for admiration was so insatiable,
that even his was acceptable. While the whole
party were so goodnatured, so agreeable, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
much amused; yet so much too well bred to
show it in the rude and flagrant manner indulged
in by too many towards those labouring
under natural infirmities, that poor Sir James
was perfectly delighted, and felt as if he was
among the most charming, kind, agreeable
people in the whole world.</p>

<p>The Misses Salter had in the mean time
made several attempts to bow to Mrs. Dorothea;
but that lady always took care to be so much occupied
with other people, as to make it impossible
for them to catch her eye. She however noticed
their proceedings; and observing that some
time after the desertion of Sir James, Sir William
Orm arrived and joined them, she laid her plans
accordingly. Sir William would not do to introduce
to her nieces, but he should nevertheless
desert Miss Salter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>The walk now began to thin; on which the
Arden party, having invited Sir James and
Henry Lindsey home with them to breakfast,
an invitation very usual on the Cheltenham promenade,
took the path which led to their own
villa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>When breakfast was over, and the gentlemen
had taken their departure, Louisa was amazingly
laughed at by her sisters about her new
lover.</p>

<p>He was mimicked and ridiculed in every possible
way; walk, air, manner, voice, modes of expression,
ways of looking, &amp;c. &amp;c.; till the girls
had perfectly fatigued themselves with laughing.</p>

<p>We have heard it said, that it was a service
of danger for any man to become the admirer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
one of a large family; for that, let him be ever
so successful in talking the lady of his choice
into love, she was sure the moment he absented
himself to be laughed out of it again by her sisters.
It is no wonder, then, that poor Sir James
did not escape. Lady Arden, however, and Mrs.
Dorothea came from time to time to the rescue
of the little baronet's memory.</p>

<p>"Heedless creatures!" said Aunt Dorothea,
"how little thought you give to the future!"</p>

<p>"I only hope he may be serious, and really
propose for Louisa," said Lady Arden; "and if
he should, I trust she will have the sense to
pause before she rejects so advantageous an
offer."</p>

<p>"But then, mamma, is he not a fool?" asked
Louisa.</p>

<p>"Why no, my dear, not exactly that. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>deed,
I know a great many ill-tempered, reserved
sort of men, without a grain more sense,
who pass for Solomons! He is a vain little
man, certainly; and perhaps too goodnatured.
But then, only consider what a vastly <i>eligible</i>
establishment it would be: you would have rank
yourself, and be at once restored to the wealth
and station lost to you all by the death of your
father; and what, my dear, is still more important,
you would be rescued <i>in time</i> from the
comparative poverty, and consequent obscurity
into which you must ultimately sink, if you survive
me unmarried."</p>

<p>What dilemmas so humiliating as those to
which <i>Pride</i> reduces its votaries!</p>

<p>Lady Arden, by nature amiable, affectionate,
and high-minded; but by education tainted with
false pride, thus stooped to the very depth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
meanness, unconscious of degradation; and sacrificed
her purest feelings to the supposed necessity
of securing to her daughters that artificial
station in life which a system of unjust
monopoly had for a time given them, and of
which the same system had again deprived them.</p>

<p>Artificial positions in society, like unnatural
attitudes of the body, cannot be long persisted
in without pain and weariness. Where is the
dignity of human nature? Forgotten! for were
it remembered, the beggar, when educated, might
share it with us; and at this false pride takes
alarm! And, therefore, do we leave man out
of the account, and worship idols of silver and
idols of gold, and titles made of the breath of
our own lips.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"From <i>Pride</i> our very reasoning springs."</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Louisa had nothing to say against such unanswerable
arguments as those Lady Arden had
used; but she thought of Henry Lindsey, and
could not help wishing that he had been the
elder brother, or, at least, that the fortune had
been divided: even seven thousand five hundred
with him would have been better, she could not
help thinking, than the whole fifteen thousand
with Sir James.</p>

<p>"It is always desirable," continued Lady
Arden, "that a girl should marry in the same
station as her father; but it is not always practicable,
particularly if she is a daughter of the
elder branch; for no family can have more than
one elder son, while many may have half a dozen
daughters, no one of whom ought, in common
prudence, to marry a younger brother!!"</p>

<p>"Nay," said Alfred, "is not this sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
show how absurdly society is constituted? What
is to become, then, of five out of every six daughters,
and all the younger sons in the world?
What is to become of my hapless self, for instance?"</p>

<p>"We must hope, my dear, that you may be
fortunate, and meet with an heiress."</p>

<p>"But consider, ma'am, how few heiresses
there are. Parliament ought to make a new
batch every session. It would, however, be of
no use to me if they did," he added, despondingly,
"for heiresses, of course, consider themselves
entitled to marry, not only elder sons, but
noblemen. I have often thought what is to become
of me, if I should ever have the misfortune
to fall in love."</p>

<p>"You did, I think, fall half in love one evening
in town," said Jane.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"And, by-the-by," observed Lady Arden,
"Lady Caroline Montague is an heiress."</p>

<p>Alfred coloured, and rising, sauntered towards
a window as he replied, "And, therefore, very
unlikely to be allowed to cast away a thought
on an unfor&mdash;&mdash;" Here he broke off, and after
gazing for a time from the window, exclaimed,
"That was certainly she&mdash;I had but a momentary
view, but I am quite sure it was she I saw
pluck a rose in that next garden, and run into
the house again. Can they be living in the adjoining
villa to us?"</p>

<p>The grass gardens or little lawns of these twin
villas were separated only by wire palings, along
which sweet briar and flowering shrubs were
trained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>The family party, with the addition of Lord
Darlingford, Sir James Lindsey, and his brother,
were assembled round the luncheon-table at
Lady Arden's.</p>

<p>Henry Lindsey had been amazingly piqued
that morning by Louisa's reception of Sir
James. The little baronet was now seated next
to her, and making, if possible, a greater fool of
himself than usual; while, in consequence of
the lesson she had received, she was yielding
him her attention with marked complacency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Henry sat opposite, and trembled with a
mingling of agitation and indignation. He
thought he could already foresee that he was
to be deliberately immolated to avarice; yet,
so thoroughly was he the slave of Louisa's
beauty and his own passion, that no worthlessness
on her part could have set him free. He
felt, that were she already the wife of his
brother, her image might drive him mad, but
that he could not banish it from his imagination.</p>

<p>The hardship of Henry Lindsey's case as a
younger brother was conspicuous, and displayed
in a striking manner the evils consequent
upon sacrificing justice to <i>pride</i>.</p>

<p>From a boy he had felt much on this subject;
but being of a generous, warm-hearted,
liberal nature, he did not long brood over his
own individual wrongs; his mind, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
following the impulse thus received, though in
the first instance from a selfish feeling, gave itself
to the contemplation and discussion of natural
rights generally, till it became enamoured
of abstract justice, and learned to apply its
searching test to every subject, especially the
all absorbing topic of the day&mdash;Political
Economy; while, with his characteristic enthusiasm,
despising the sophisms of expediency,
he embraced, without perhaps sufficient caution,
theories which soon caused him to be considered
by his friends a reformer, by his enemies
almost a revolutionist, and by himself the warm
advocate of the rights, not of younger brothers
only, but of those whom he emphatically termed
the step-children of the laws&mdash;<i>The People</i>.</p>

<p>Such were at all times his opinions, while
the irritable state of his mind, at the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of which we are speaking, added asperity to his
manner of expressing himself, and caused him,
in answer to some jesting remark of Alfred's
on the old topic of younger brothers, to give
vent to his feelings in a long, and almost angry
political discussion. He objected, he said, to
the law of primogeniture on the ground of its
being a wretched system of monopoly, which
placed in the hands of a simple individual what,
if divided, would suffice to restore thousands of
his degraded and oppressed fellow-creatures to
the rank of humanity. The times were gone
by when communities, formed for the general
weal, would wilfully sacrifice prosperity to
<i>pride</i>, and not only parcel out the whole land
to, comparatively speaking, a few families, but
the succession to those lands being limited to
the elder branches, allow all place, preferment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
and emolument, to be confined to the younger
sons of the same families, because the land
had given them influence; and the mass of
the people to be thus reduced to do the work
of the ass and the mule, and because they
cannot also eat their food, the grass and the
thistle, be often in danger of starvation.</p>

<p>The old feudal system itself was better than
this: the ancient baron was at least bound to
feed not only his relations but his vassals, and
he did so in his own hall, at his own table.
While, now-a-days, a man, as soon as his
father's funeral is over, turns his brothers
and sisters out of doors, to exist as they may,
on a pitiful portion, the principal of which is
in general infinitely less than one year's
income of the property, on the scale of which
they have been accustomed to live in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
father's time; while the new master permits
his servants to collect their wages by showing
the empty baronial hall to strangers at so much
per head, by which creditable means he is
himself enabled to reserve all his rents to stake
at hazard in London, or at <i>rouge et noir</i> in Paris.
When parliament is sitting, he must of course
attend, to vote against any infringement on
his monopoly, which the enlightened spirit of
the times may chance to propose. Thanks,
however, to the Reform Bill, the holders of
the monopolies are no longer our sole law-givers;
we have now some <i>chance</i> of justice <i>one
time or another</i>.</p>

<p>"Besides," he added, "to return to the
ancient baron, he was not only bound to
feed his retainers, but in time of war to provide
the government with a certain number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
them, fitly clothed and armed; which was virtually
bearing the burdens of the state. The
baron was, in point of fact, but the trustee to a
certain property, which property was to feed a
certain number of the population, and to contribute
its due proportion to the defence of the
community. Instead of this, when the feudal
system becomes dangerous to government the
barons are forbidden to arm, and exonerated from
feeding their retainers; yet, the trust-property
left in their hands for <i>pocket-money</i>, while their
late followers are not only turned out on the
wide world to starve, but the taxes necessary
to maintain the army which the barons are
forbid to provide, are levied on the <i>bare palms</i>
of the <i>hands</i> of the thus turned out and starving
vassals; and not satisfied with this injustice,
those who thus keep possession of the trust-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>lands,
have arrived at literally billeting their
younger sons on those said vassals, thus turned
out and starving."</p>

<p>"Explain! explain!" cried Lord Darlingford,
"How can you make that out?"</p>

<p>"Are not," replied Henry, "the salaries and
pensions of all the posts and sinecures they
hold paid by means of taxes, a great proportion
of which are levied on industry? Is
this as it should be? If the <i>pride</i> of the great
demand that their properties shall be inherited
by their elder sons, and the offspring of that
<i>pride</i>&mdash;if <i>false necessity</i>, require that places and
sinecures be provided for their younger sons,
should not the <i>rich co-operate</i> in raising a fund
for the payment of the salaries of such, and not
grind their thousands by pittances from the
<i>real necessities</i> of the <i>poor</i>?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"What then is your panacea for so many
crying ills?" asked Lord Darlingford, "Do
you call on us to render up our trusts and proclaim
an Agrarian law?"</p>

<p>"No; those whose motives are honest dare
not go such lengths. This would be to resolve
society into its mere elements, to open the flood-gates
of anarchy, and awake the savage spirit
of wanton plunder. Many large landed properties
too have been purchased with the wages
of industry; so that besides the horrible convulsions
attendant upon the dissolution of the
social system, there would be no such thing as
drawing the line; to avoid, therefore, worse
evils, I would allow the 'frightful disparities,'
as an able writer of the day terms them, to exist
till industry, unchecked, unladen, could work
out for itself a gradual emancipation from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
bondage of want. But I would not add to
evils I dare not too suddenly remedy! I would
not require the children of Israel to make
bricks without straw! I would not lay the
burdens of the state on shoulders already
weighed down by nature's demand for daily
bread. I would exempt from the whole weight
of taxation the labourer, whether of brain or
limb; he has no stake in the stability of the
state; he can carry his head or his hand wherever
he goes. He who keeps back the hire of
the labourer is denounced in holy writ: I would
not be worse than such, and rob the labourer of
his hire. I would, therefore, repeal every tax
<i>direct</i> and <i>indirect</i>, which now exists, and substitute
for <i>all</i> a graduated property-tax, on
<i>independent</i> property <i>only</i>, trifling in amount, say
one per cent., where the property was small; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
doubling, trebling, nay, quadrupling, if necessary,
as it rises. What, if a man with thirty thousand
per annum, pay twenty thousand, can he not
live on ten? or if the man with two hundred
thousand per annum, pay one hundred and fifty
thousand, can he not live on fifty? This,
some people are not ashamed to answer me
would be robbing the rich; while they talk as
loudly as vaguely of the sacredness of property
and vested rights. But I would answer such,
that starvation in the midst of plenty, on the
plea of the sacredness of justice, is a practical
blasphemy! What, therefore, relief from taxation
did not effect for the absolutely destitute,
I would complete by an amended system of
poor-laws;&mdash;such assessments, however, to be
levied on independent property only."</p>

<p>"Poor-laws are bad things," interrupted Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
James, who having finished his luncheon, was
now lolling on a sofa, "they make the common
people so lazy."</p>

<p>"As long as industry is not taxed in support
of idleness," answered Henry, "the lazy rich
man is entitled to no commiseration for being
compelled to assist his brother, the lazy poor
man! Poor-laws," he added, turning to Lord
Darlingford, "as far at least as food goes, I
consider the most sacred of vested rights.
God said, 'Behold, I have given you every
herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all
the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit
of a tree yielding seed, to you it shall be for
meat.'"</p>

<p>"But you allow," said his lordship, "that
many of the great landed properties you would
tax thus heavily are purchased with the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>duce
of the owner's own exertions; state your
reasons for giving immunity to present industry
and not to past?"</p>

<p>"Because," replied Henry, "when once a
man has realized property he has acquired a
stake in the country, a stake in the stability of
the government; his property requires protection,
whether from the foreign enemy or the
home depredator; and, therefore, he should
pay for such protection. If a man desires a
wall round his garden, who pays for building
the wall? The man who owns the garden!
If a man wishes to insure his premises against
fire, who pays the insurance? The man whose
premises are guaranteed. Would either of these
persons dream of calling a parish meeting to
demand of their neighbours as a right, that they
should subscribe towards the expense so incurred;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
nay, that every pauper subsisting on some shilling
or two per week, should be compelled to
pay two-pence for his penny loaf until the sum
was made up; yet, such is the spirit of every
tax, direct or indirect, levied on any thing but
independent property. The machinery of government
is the garden-wall of the landed
interest, the insurance office of the fund-holder.
Any tax, therefore, levied on those who have
neither land nor money is a crying injustice,
except, indeed," he added with bitter irony,
"we admit of a small pole-tax to keep down
burking. It is, no doubt, the houseless, nameless,
friendless wretch, who has no one to ask
what is become of him; the poor creature, who
has nothing to be protected but the limbs and
sinews he was born with, who runs the greatest risk
of contributing these to the promotion of science."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"But," observed Lord Darlingford, "it is not
the very destitute who pay taxes."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Henry, "indirect
ones they do. If the beggar in the street succeeds
in exciting the compassion of the passenger,
and receives one penny, ere he can appease
his hunger with a mouthful of bread, do
not the corn laws, by doubling the price of the
loaf, exact from him one half of the penny so
obtained? And is not his mite, thus cast into
the treasury, like that of the poor widow in the
Gospel, taken from his <i>want</i>; and, therefore,
more than all they (<i>the rich</i>) did cast in of their
abundance?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is all but too true!" said Lady Arden,
feelingly. "I do think your scheme of taxation
would be but justice. Willoughby would certainly
have a great deal to pay; but he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
surely afford it better than poor creatures who
have nothing but what they earn, or what they
beg. I see the subject now in quite a new
light. I have always been in the habit of thinking
people <i>poor</i> who had but <i>one</i> or <i>two</i> thousands
a-year; and I never took the trouble of
considering that there was any difference between
hundreds a-year and nothing."</p>

<p>"How would you apportion this property-tax
of yours?" asked Lord Darlingford; "and how
ensure its being sufficient for the exigencies of
the state?"</p>

<p>"On a graduated scale, as I have already
said," replied Henry, "from justice to individuals:
let those who have the largest property
to ensure, pay, as at all other insurance offices,
the most; but, as to details and calculations, I
leave those to Mr. Hume, or some of the multi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>plication
table people; I only advocate the principle.
Indeed, one of the great recommendations
of this plan is, that the principle once established,
the work is done: when those who tie up the burdens
have to carry them, they may be trusted to
find scales of sufficient nicety in which to weigh
them: we need, in that case, no longer call for
estimates, or petition against sinecures; nay, we
may give the very voting of the subsidies to the
<i>Lords</i> themselves!&mdash;many of whom, I make no
doubt, would forthwith become immortalised by
the economical or '<i>twopenny halfpenny</i>' ingenuity,
developed in the devising of future
budgets. '<i>Twopence halfpenny</i>,' I would have
the noble lords to know, though no object to
them, is a sum which many of their destitute
fellow-creatures would, at this moment, receive
with joy of heart! Then, remember, in further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
recommendation of this scheme, the millions a-year
of unprofitable expense that would be saved
to the nation, by having but one instead of innumerable
taxes to levy."</p>

<p>"I don't think," said Sir James, looking as if
he had made a discovery, "that the people with
large fortunes will like this law of yours, Henry."</p>

<p>"Many people, too," replied Henry, contemptuously,
"don't like paying their Christmas
bills."</p>

<p>Alfred, who had been looking over a morning
paper near a window, and from time to time
lending a share of his attention to the disputants,
now joined them.</p>

<p>"We cannot, I think," he said, "blame any
particular government, or set of men, for the
ills of which you complain. The fault is in
human nature; and the remedy, if there be one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
is only to be found in laying step by step the
wisest general restrictions we can on individual
selfishness. The advance of civilization has
already placed a salutary check on plunder by
force; it remains for the march of intellect to
discover one for plunder by stratagem. But we
must be cautious; in desiring the higher steps
of the ladder of wisdom and virtue, we must not
undervalue those we have attained, and in our
headlong haste, stumble; and, like our neighbours
of the continent, fall back on the frightful
abyss of anarchy that lays below! 'Tis well to
rise in excellence; I hate the cant of dreading
all chance: but, to keep to the simile of the ladder,
let us take care that the lifting foot be
firmly placed on the step above, ere the standing
one be removed from the step below."</p>

<p>"Is there not some danger," said Lord Dar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>lingford,
"of a property-tax sending capital out
of the kingdom?"</p>

<p>"It must be very easy," replied Henry, "for
the inventors of all sorts of protecting duties to
devise a means of meeting that difficulty, by
some ingeniously arranged tax on the exportation
of property, whether income or capital, with
a tremendously deterring fine on any attempt at
imposition; and minor exactments, to hunt evasion
through all its windings. There might,
also," he added, "be an alien tax, to prevent
the foreign artizan from sharing the immunity
from taxation, purchased by our own rich for
our own poor."</p>

<p>"Is there not some danger," said Lady Arden,
"that the deteriorated incomes of the great, by
obliging them to lessen their establishments and
expenditure, would throw many people out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
employment, and so increase the numbers of the
poor?"</p>

<p>"I should think not," answered Henry; "recollect
there would be the same property in the
kingdom, only in more general and more equal
circulation. The servants dismissed, and the
luxuries foregone by the few, would in all probability
be more than compensated by the
increased establishments and more numerous
comforts of the many, though each only in a
small degree. The standard of splendour might
be lowered, but that of comfort would be raised.
The change, too, is likely to be in favour of
home productions: the overflow of inordinate
wealth, the <i>too much</i> of the few, is frequently
squandered on luxuries obtained from abroad;
while the fertilizing sufficiency, the <i>enough</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the many, would probably be expended on comforts
produced at home.</p>

<p>"I do not, however," he added, "mean to
assume the character of a prophet, or even to
argue the point of future consequences; I take
higher ground, and end every such discussion
with the same appeal to duty:</p>

<p>"Let each generation do what is clearly justice
in their own day, and leave the future to the
All-wise Disposer of events.</p>

<p>"If there were, indeed, a theory through the
mazes of which moral rectitude knew no path,
we might be excusable in taking calculation for
our guide; but when our road lies before us, indicated
by duty's steadily pointing finger, we are
not entitled to balance ere we proceed, even
though it should be where four frequented
highways meet."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Dorothea, the sisters, and Sir James, had
got tired of politics, and wandered into the garden.
Henry, perceiving that Sir James was still
in attendance on Louisa, became impatient,
broke off the conversation abruptly, and following
them, joined her, saying, "Lord Darlingford
is too prudent a politician for me. I hate prudence
and calculation, and worldly mindedness,"
he added, with impetuosity, and a provoked
and mortified tone of voice, which Louisa was
at no loss to comprehend. "The present artificial
state of society," he proceeded, "has banished
into the poet's dream every thing worth
living for!&mdash;there alone all things deserving
the ambition of an intellectual being now hold
their unreal existence! Beauty has become a
snare&mdash;feeling a folly, or a curse!&mdash;love a farce,
and lovely woman, nature's most cunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
workmanship, a <i>toy</i>, a <i>trinket</i>, which the rich
man may draw out his purse and purchase!!!&mdash;heart
and all!" he subjoined, in an under and
somewhat softened voice, for Louisa had looked
round, and their eyes had met for a moment.
"Is it so?" he continued; "or are the beautiful
looking deceptions now made to suit the <i>market</i>
for which they are intended, <i>without hearts</i>?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether Alfred's study was pamphlet,
newspaper, or magazine, he could never contrive
to discern the print by any light but that of the
window, or rather glass door, at which we left
him standing on the morning on which he first
discerned the fleeting semblance of a fair vision
in the adjoining garden. The glass door was
generally half open, a muslin blind drawn half
down across it, and the eyes of the student, like
those of the naughty child in the pictures of
bold Harry, just visible over the top of his book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>On such occasions one of his sisters would
often glide behind him, and startling him with a
loud burlesque sigh, exclaim, "She is not there
to-day." "Nonsense!" Alfred would say,
rising. "This is a very well written thing,"
he added one morning, throwing his book on a
table.</p>

<p>"What is it about, Alfred?" asked Madeline
archly. He took up the book again to examine
it before he could answer the question; "I declare
he can't tell," she cried, "without looking
at the top of the page;" a general burst of
laughter followed, from which Alfred escaped
into the garden. He had long since made it his
business to ascertain that Lady Palliser and her
daughter inhabited the next villa; but few, very
few indeed, and "far between," had been the
glimpses of his beauteous enslaver which his late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
studious habits and love of good light had procured
for him.</p>

<p>Lady Caroline appeared to be conscious that
the garden was exposed to the view of their
neighbours, and was therefore timid about entering
it; or, when she did so, as on the first
occasion noticed, it was only to pluck a flower,
for she seemed fearful of remaining in it for
a moment. This morning, however, both mother
and daughter had appeared on the lawn and
with bonnets on, which, combined with the
early hour, had caused Alfred to suspect
them of an intention of visiting the walks;
and his consequent anticipations of a possible
meeting, had, we must confess, made him rather
absent.</p>

<p>He now called in at the window to his sisters
to know if they were not yet ready, assuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
them that the band had played several tunes,
and that they would be late.</p>

<p>"Don't you know that the Duke of Gloucester
has arrived?" he continued, "did you not hear
the joy bells yesterday evening? He is so punctual
to seven, that the fashionables are always
early when he is here."</p>

<p>This remonstrance had the desired effect;
final arrangements were quickly completed and
the party set forth.</p>

<p>On entering the Montpelier walk, Alfred beheld,
quite near and coming towards them, Lady
Palliser and her daughter, in company with the
duke, and attended by two or three of his
grace's aides-de-camp.</p>

<p>Alfred saw that Lady Caroline perceived and
recognised him, for she coloured instantly, but
looked as if she did not know whether she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
ought to acknowledge him or not; while he was
so much startled and confounded, that he had
not presence of mind to look for a recognition.
Lady Palliser happened to be conversing with
his grace, and did not see him. He passed,
therefore, unacknowledged by either lady.</p>

<p>The next turn, the next and the next again,
he was determined to manage matters better,
and accordingly kept a regular look out for
the duke's party, but they were nowhere to be
seen; it was evident they had been going off
the walk at the time he met them.</p>

<p>How dull the whole gay scene became the
moment this conviction reached him! How irksome
the frivolity of every body's manner;
while all the world, seeming to have made the
discovery simultaneously with himself, kept
telling each other as they passed that the duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
was gone, just as if it was done on purpose to
torment him.</p>

<p>In vain did Miss Salter, every time he encountered
the party, address Lady Flamborough
by her title, in an unnecessarily loud tone, to
endeavour to draw his attention by showing him
what exalted company she was in. Every effort
was thrown away upon him, as well as all the
extra finery sported this day on purpose for the
duke. Little did his grace think how many
husbands and fathers he had caused to grumble.
As for poor Lady Whaleworthy, in her loyal zeal
to make herself fit company for royalty, she
actually crowned herself with the gold tissue
turban which she wore at Mr. Salter's dinner; so
that with this and her everlasting crimson velvet
pelisse, to which she had added a gold waist-band
for the occasion, she was altogether as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
fine as the hammer cloth of a lord mayor's
coach.</p>

<p>Lady Flamborough trusted more to her natural
attractions; these she displayed for the
great occasion with a liberality which certainly
did succeed in calling forth a remark from his
grace, though by no means a complimentary
one.</p>

<p>The new bonnets sported this morning would
require the calculating boy to count them; and
as for shoes, many a simple-hearted girl fresh
from the country, submitted to hours of actual
torture, in order that the Duke of Gloucester
might go back to London convinced that she
had very small feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>The next morning Alfred was on his guard,
and watched the first approaches of the duke's
party with a palpitating heart.</p>

<p>But, alas! Lady Palliser, as before, was occupied
and saw him not; while, what was much
worse, it was evident that Lady Caroline did see
him at a distance, and from that moment kept
her eyes fixed on the ground. They passed each
other, and he could discern the glow of consciousness
steal over her cheek as they did so.
Again and again they passed&mdash;still without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
recognition; till at length he scarcely ventured
to look that way. Lord Darlingford now appeared.
He attached himself to Lady Arden's
party&mdash;Jane in particular. After a turn or two,
he apologised for quitting them, saying he must
go and speak to Lady Palliser. Alfred, forming
a sudden and desperate resolve, at which he
often afterwards looked back with astonishment,
took his lordship's arm, and accompanied him.
The duke had just quitted the walk, and Lady
Palliser, quite <i>dsoeuvre</i>, happened at the
moment to be in what she called a humour
for being spoken to. She received, therefore,
not only Lord Darlingford but Alfred with the
utmost graciousness. Caroline, after a timid
glance at her mother's countenance, looked round
and recognised our hero with a smile that
seemed to open to him in an instant the gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of Paradise. Nay, the Montpelier walk itself
became, as by a sudden revelation, the very garden
of Eden to his delighted eyes. He was
walking next to Caroline&mdash;he did not know how
he had got there! He was speaking to her&mdash;he
did not know what he was saying! Her countenance
was turned towards him to reply, while
the close bonnet which, while it was so turned,
hid its loveliness from every eye. It was a slight
summer one of simple snowy sarcenet, and though
it warded off the glare of the out-door sun-beam,
it admitted through its half transparent texture a
heavenly kind of light, which at once accurately
defined, and seemed a fitting shrine for the perfectly
angelic features around which it dwelt:
the pure lively red of the lovely moving lip,
where all else was so white; the smile of enchantment,
exposing to view the pearly teeth; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
delicately pencilled brow; the large dark eyes,
which yet were so soft, so modestly raised, so
meek in their expression, that their very lustre
seemed that of compassion's tear ere it o'erflows
the lid! Yet did their mild beams make such
an unmerciful jumble of all Alfred's ideas, that
he was quite sure he must be talking nonsense.
But there was no help for it; if he spoke not, he
saw but the fluted outside of the white sarcenet
bonnet; it was necessary to make ceaseless appeals
to Caroline's attention, or the graceful
head would not be turned towards him; the
lovely eyes would not be raised to his, the
beauteous lips, fresh as rose leaves moist with
morning dew, would not be parted in reply; to
purchase delights such as these he was compelled
to risk his reputation as a sage, and go on
without an effort to think. At length, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
he came to an unlucky pause, and instead of
jumping over it, unfortunately began to weigh
what subject he should next propound. But,
alas! the precious moments flew past in rapid
succession, and, one after another, became absorbed
in the gulph of eternity, while our poor
hero was still at a stand.</p>

<p>And now strange uneasy sensations began to
blend with the dream-like felicity he had hitherto
enjoyed, though he was not yet awake to the
cause, which was simply this: the band was
playing that well known note of dismissal&mdash;the
national anthem&mdash;and anticipations of approaching
separation began to steal over his senses.
To his surprise and infinite delight, however,
Lady Palliser suddenly asked Lord Darlingford
and himself, with the prettiest and most petitioning
manner possible, to go home with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
party to breakfast. We need scarcely say that
Alfred consented; so did Lord Darlingford,
though not quite so willingly, for he had intended
to return to Lady Arden's party.</p>

<p>After this morning, Alfred not only joined his
new friends whenever they appeared, but became
in a short time almost a daily visitor at
Jessamine bower; and apparently with the entire
approbation of Lady Palliser. Indeed, it was
in general some message or some commission of
her ladyship's, or some allusion to the morrow
made at parting, almost amounting to an appointment,
which furnished him with an excuse for
calling. He, poor fellow, was flattered, delighted,
filled with hope and joy! But, alas!
he was not sufficiently acquainted with the
character of Lady Palliser to understand his
own position. Her ladyship was a being with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>out
affections and without occupation; who in
her intercourse with others, and from total heartlessness,
cared not whose best feelings were
the springs of the puppet-show, so the movements
of the puppets amused her&mdash;and he happened
to be the whim of the hour;&mdash;to order
him about, to see him perfectly at her disposal,
chanced to be what, just then, afforded a species
of excitement to her restless idleness and morbid
selfishness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>Meanwhile much of Caroline's excessive
reserve, or rather fearfulness of manner wore
off. In her mother's immediate presence indeed
she was ever the same; but if Lady Palliser
quitted the room for a moment, or was
occupied conversing with some other visitor,
Caroline's countenance would brighten, and her
manner become comparatively easy and happy.
Fully, however, to comprehend our heroine, it
will be necessary to cast a retrospective glance
over the manner of her education.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>The most painful silence of the heart and all
its best affections had from infancy been habitual
to Caroline. She was an only child, and
had no recollection of her father; while her
mother's strange, unfeeling character, had made
her from the very first shrink within herself.
When arrived at an age at which young people,
not self-opinionated, naturally wish to ask those
older than themselves what they ought to do on
various little occasions, which seem to them
important from their novelty, poor Caroline
would sometimes, in what she deemed a
case of urgency, make a great effort and apply
to her mother, on which Lady Palliser would
treat her simplicity as the best of good jokes,
laugh to excess, then rally her for blushing,
and next perhaps for shedding tears; and,
finally, either leave her question without reply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
or give one turning the subject into absolute
ridicule; till at last Caroline learned to
feel a terror surpassing description of having
any one thought, feeling, or opinion even
guessed at by her mother. Yet her mother was
her only companion. There was also a strange
inconsistency in the character and conduct of
Lady Palliser; for while she never condescended
to advise, she was tyrannical in her commands,
exacting implicit, unquestioned, instantaneous
obedience to every whim.</p>

<p>Either there was something in the thorough
kindliness of Alfred's disposition which appeared
in his manner, and secretly won the
confidence of our heroine; or fate had ordained
that they were to love each other.
Whatever the cause, the consequence was,
that Caroline, after the intimacy we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
described had subsisted for some weeks, no
longer felt alone in the world&mdash;she was no
longer without thoughts that gave her pleasure;
while those thoughts, though for their ostensible
object they had a walk, a song, a book, or a
flower, were always associated with the idea of
Alfred&mdash;of something that he had said&mdash;or some
little kind service he had performed&mdash;or, perhaps,
some chance encounter of his eye&mdash;or the
consciousness of his fixed gaze, felt without daring
to look up, and which, though it had produced
strange confusion of ideas at the time, was remembered
with delight. Neither was she any
longer without hope, though but a hope that
they might meet on the walks, or that he
might come in about something she had heard
her mother mention to him.</p>

<p>It may be asked why should Caroline not al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>ways
have had the hopes with which most
young people enter life; merely because the
buoyancy of youth had been pressed down, and
the elasticity of its spirits destroyed, by the unnatural
restraint under which every thought and
feeling had been held during the period that her
earliest affections had, as is generally the case,
endeavoured to fix themselves on her parent.</p>

<p>As for Alfred, he had misgivings certainly,
respecting his being a younger brother, and his
consequent want of fortune. At the same time,
when he felt that he was justified in harbouring
the restless, delightful hope, that he was already
not quite indifferent to Caroline, and that he
received such decided encouragement as he
did from her mother, what could he think,
but that he was the most fortunate fellow in existence,
and that he had met with the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
generous, liberal minded, delightful people in
the whole world!</p>

<p>Sometimes, indeed, he would take a fastidious
fit, and murmur a little in his heart against fate,
for compelling him to be the one to receive,
and denying him the pride and pleasure of bestowing;
but so absorbing was his passion
for Caroline, that he soon closed his eyes
against this objection, almost as absolutely as
he would have done against the contrary had it
existed. He was incapable, in short, at the time,
of weighing any subject deliberately: a look, a
smile, or the unbidden brightening of Caroline's
countenance when they met, would have been
sufficient to have upset the firmest resolves, had
he even been visited by a lucid interval in which
to have formed them; but on the contrary, from
the first morning he had been so unexpectedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
invited home by Lady Palliser, his head had
become giddy with rapture; the pulsations of his
heart had never settled down to their steady
original pace, nor had any one thought or feeling
ever once been summoned before the bar of
reason. That it must be a fairy tale&mdash;a dream&mdash;too
much happiness to be true, would sometimes
cross his imagination for a moment, and strike
his heart with a sort of panic; but such
thoughts not being agreeable enough to meet
with a welcome within, were therefore quickly
dismissed.</p>

<p>Whenever he was neither at Lady Palliser's
nor at his old post at the window, he was wandering
in some unfrequented walk, or reclining
listlessly on a remote sofa in a deep reverie,
calling to mind looks, smiles, or half uttered re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>plies,
from which, while they said nothing, every
thing might be inferred.</p>

<p>He studied and learned to comprehend as a
language hitherto unknown, the timid, shrinking,
as yet undeveloped character of Caroline.
To him her very silence now conveyed more than
the eloquence of others; and however long he
watched the downcast lid, if it was raised at
last but for a second, he was amply rewarded.</p>

<p>And when he repaired to Jessamine Bower,
to pay his now daily morning visit, and on entering
addressed Lady Palliser first, as he made
a point of doing, he literally trembled with concealed
emotion as he noted the slight tinge,
faint as the reflection from a rose leaf, steal over
Caroline's delicate cheek, while she continued
to bend over her employment, whatever it might
be, and acting her part unnecessarily well, en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>deavoured
to betray no consciousness of his presence,
till her attention was absolutely claimed
by some such formal address as&mdash;</p>

<p>"How is Lady Caroline this morning?"
Formal as were the words, the tone of the voice
was sufficient. The faint tinge would increase
to a deep blush, ere the equally formed reply
was articulated. On many occasions, Alfred
would continue to converse with Lady Palliser,
or perform any of her frivolous and whimsical
commands, and nothing more apparently would
pass between the young people; yet would he,
the while, trace in slight variations of countenance,
imperceptible to any other eye, all that
Caroline thought or felt with regard to what was
said. Sometimes Lady Palliser herself would
suddenly fling down her netting or knotting, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
whatever nonsense she was about, with an expression
of disgust, declare she was sick of it,
and ordering Alfred to look for her pet book of
Italian Trios, and Caroline to put away her drawing
and join them, seat herself at the instrument.</p>

<p>This to Caroline and Alfred was a wonderful
improvement of position. Standing together
behind Lady Palliser's chair, their voices
united in the thrilling harmonies of the music,
and sometimes in the utterance of words expressive
of thoughts, which else one at least of
the voices had never dared to pronounce. On
one of these favourable occasions a circumstance
occurred, trivial in the extreme, yet which forwarded
Alfred's cause amazingly, and indeed
conveyed to both a tacit conviction of each
other's attachment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>A hand of each while they sang rested on the
back of Lady Palliser's chair, and after a simultaneous
attempt to turn over the leaf of the
music-book, accidentally came in contact as they
returned to their former position. It had been
long ere a modest younger brother, like our poor
hero, had found courage to possess himself
by any direct means of the fair, soft, taper
fingered, rosy palmed, little hand, of the
great heiress, the beautiful Lady Caroline
Montague; but an occasion like this was not
to be resisted: Alfred's trembling fingers closed
upon the fond treasure; while a hasty but faint
effort of Caroline's to withdraw it, was met by
a beseeching look that seemed to have the desired
effect; for, though covered with blushes,
she did not immediately succeed in disengaging
the hand, while the little scene was at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>moment supplied by the duet with appropriate words.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/image01_musicscore01.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center">Langue il mio co-re per te d'a-mo-re.</p>

<p>Sang Alfred, while Caroline in faltering notes
replied</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/image02_musicscore02.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center">Non so re-sis-te-re.</p>

<p>When our hero had taken his departure
Caroline hastened to her own apartment. She
felt unfit for any society, particularly her
mother's.</p>

<p>Her pure unpractised delicacy of mind caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
her to look back on the incident which had
just passed as an event of the utmost importance;
as, in short, not only a proposal,
but also an acceptance. Nay, had she
wished it, she would no longer have thought
herself at liberty to retract; for she knew
that she would not have allowed a man
who was indifferent to her to have retained
her hand in his for a single second. That she
had permitted Alfred then to do so, she felt
amounted to a confession of preference! Deep
was the blush which accompanied this
thought.</p>

<p>At other times Lady Palliser would be extravagantly
late in the morning; and, if consequently
not in the drawing-room when our
hero called, she would send word that Mr.
Arden was not to go away till she came down;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and then so whimsical were all her movements,
not perhaps make her appearance for an hour,
or possibly two. Those were the occasions on
which Alfred best succeeded in drawing Caroline
into easy and familiar conversation, and thus
inducing in her a feeling of confidence towards
himself, which a young creature who had been
blessed with any friend in her own family,
would not have thought of mingling with her
love for a lover: but the affection poor Caroline
was beginning to feel towards Alfred was not
only her <i>First Love</i>, but it was also the first
friendship her heart had ever been encouraged
to know. Thus it was, that to a being hitherto
so totally alone in the world, he became in so
short a time every thing. While the idea,
however vaguely entertained, of being at some
period of the future of existence protected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
his affection from every harshness&mdash;sheltered by
his tenderness from every sorrow, had almost
unconsciously became the hope, the home, the
resting place of all her anticipations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how are you to ask us to the wedding,
Alfred, considering we don't even visit?" said
Louisa one morning to her brother, who stood
as usual at the window, but now without even
the pretext of a book.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Louisa!" he replied. "Wedding,
indeed! I wish it were come to that! and it
would be easy to arrange the visiting. By-the-by,
ma'am," he added, turning to his mother,
"independent of Louisa's jesting, I wish we did
visit."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"So do I, my dear," replied Lady Arden,
"but Lady Palliser, of the two, was here rather
before I was; besides she is a person of the
highest rank, so that I think the first advances
ought to come from her. They say too, her
ladyship is going to give a great fancy ball, and
it would look as if I wanted to have the girls
asked. However, I should suppose we must
visit soon, one way or other; for Louisa's jesting
as you call it, appears to me to go on in as
serious a manner as you could desire."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I&mdash;a&mdash;don't know, ma'am," said Alfred,
colouring, and pulling off and on an unfortunate
glove, which seemed destined to be
martyred in the cause.</p>

<p>"Why certainly," persisted Lady Arden,
"neither Lady Caroline, nor her mother for her,
would be justified in receiving either your public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
attentions or your daily visits in the manner they
do, if they meant to make the only objection
which could be made to you&mdash;your being a
younger son."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I hope you may be right, ma'am;"
said Alfred, laughing, and escaping into the
garden to hide his confusion.</p>

<p>"He will be a fortunate young man if he
gets Lady Caroline Montague," said Aunt
Dorothea.</p>

<p>"Not more fortunate than he deserves, Mrs.
Dorothea," replied Lady Arden, "for he is the
best creature in the world, as well as the handsomest
and the most agreeable."</p>

<p>"No one can be more sensible of my nephew's
merits than I am," said Mrs. Dorothea; "but I
still maintain that few, even of the few who deserve
as well, are as fortunate. Lady Caroline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Montague, I understand, inherits the whole of
the family estates, and her son, should she have
one, will I suppose have the title."</p>

<p>"Why, no doubt she could command any
match," replied Lady Arden; "'tis however a
most fortunate circumstance that Lady Palliser
has the good sense to see the advantage of her
daughter marrying so thoroughly amiable a
young man, who will make her so truly
happy."</p>

<p>"Talking of happiness," said Mrs. Dorothea,
"I hope poor Jane may be happy with Lord
Darlingford."</p>

<p>"I trust she will," replied Lady Arden, with
a half suppressed sigh; "and in point both of
rank and fortune you know it is a most desirable
match."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," rejoined Mrs. Dorothea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
"and people are very foolish who neglect such
serious considerations, and allow their time to
glide by them. Were I, at this moment, as I
might have been but for my own folly, Countess
Dowager of Ravenscroft;" and here Mrs. Dorothea
drew up her head with great stiffness,
"such people as the Salters would never have
had it in their power to insult me; nor should I
have been in danger of losing my life by being
baked to death in that horrid lodging. To be
sure the carpet looked respectable, and that was
all it had to recommend it."</p>

<p>"By-the-by," said her ladyship, "I have
often wondered, Mrs. Arden, how you, who have
in general a very proper sense of your own
dignity, came to make the acquaintance of
such people as those Salts, was it you called
them?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your ladyship's remark is very just," replied
Mrs. Dorothea, "but the old friend from
whom they brought me a letter, is a highly respectable
and gentlemanly man, and I was not
aware till lately that he had only made their
acquaintance himself casually at a boarding-house,
where it seems they persecuted him with
attentions, and then worried him for a letter to
some one at Cheltenham, where they said they
were going perfect strangers. He was afraid to
enter into those particulars in the note he sent
by them, lest they should contrive to open and
read it: and the letter he since wrote me to
say how little he himself knew of them, and to
apologise for the liberty he had taken, by explaining
that they made such a point of his
giving them a line to some friend, that he did
not know how to refuse, was unfortunately de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>layed,
waiting for a frank (he knows I don't like
postages), till with my usual silly goodnature
I had taken a great deal of trouble about those
worthless people. Their vulgarity too disgusted
me all the time; yet they so overwhelmed me
with their thanks, their gratitude, as they called
it, that I literally did not know how to shake
them off."</p>

<p>"Really my dear madam," said Lady Arden,
"you are quite too goodnatured."</p>

<p>"That has always been my weak point," replied
Mrs. Dorothea: "when I see that it is in
my power to serve people, I am fool enough
to fancy that alone gives them a claim upon
me."</p>

<p>And such was really the case, for poor Mrs.
Dorothea, though she had been all her life
threatening to grow wise, in other words selfish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
had never yet attained to any degree of proficiency
in this art of self-defence, if we may so
term it. Too great goodnature was indeed her
only apology for being still at fifty-five, what
people of the world emphatically call young!
For she had not been all her days blinded by
the dazzling sunshine of unclouded prosperity;
on the contrary, her horizon had been frequently
overshadowed by those unfavourable changes,
from which, as variableness of weather teaches
the sailor seamanship, knowledge of the world is
in general collected.</p>

<p>"But we were speaking of Jane," proceeded
Mrs. Dorothea, "I have not the least doubt of
my niece's good sense. Indeed Jane is a sweet
girl, as amiable as sensible. I was only afraid
that Lord Darlingford had rather a jealous
temper."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope not!" her ladyship replied, again
sighing, "and you know, my dear Mrs. Arden,
the impossibility of having every thing one's own
way in this world. The connection, establishment,
and all that, are in the highest degree
desirable. And then between ourselves, Lord
Nelthorpe has not behaved very well to poor
Jane."</p>

<p>"In that respect, it is so far fortunate," said
Mrs. Dorothea, "that she is now making a still
higher connection. And then Sir James, with
his fifteen thousand per annum, will certainly be
a splendid match for Louisa; but she must mind
what she is about, and not laugh at him as she
now does after they are married."</p>

<p>"Of course she will have too much good sense
for that," replied Lady Arden; but her eyes
filled with silent tears as she thought of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
infinite sacrifice Louisa would make, if she did
indeed marry Sir James.</p>

<p>The three sisters had followed Alfred into the
garden, and were collecting flowers to supply
the vases in the drawing-room, and laughing in
their usual light-hearted way, if but a blossom
fell to the ground instead of into the basket
held out to catch it. Caroline the while was
standing in her mother's drawing-room, behind
a Venetian blind, through which unseen she was
observing their movements, and envying their
happiness, which to her appeared to be satisfactorily
accounted for by Alfred's being their
brother. How fervently did she wish at the
moment that she too were his sister, were it but
that she might be privileged to go out and join
the cheerful group, on which she thus wistfully
gazed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>With her solitary musing, however, a thrill
pleasure mingled, when from time to time she
saw Alfred steal a glance of interest at the very
window where she stood; and which, from the
blind being down, he suspected was occupied by
Caroline.</p>

<p>The Arden girls, at the moment, were all occupied
plucking blossoms from various parts of
a long trailing branch of woodbine, which as
it hung from above their heads, it cost them an
effort to reach.</p>

<p>"Look, look! Caroline," cried Lady Palliser,
who was standing at another window, "how like
they are to the drawings of the graces. I must
go and see Lady Arden directly, and send them
all cards; for I am determined to have those
three nice girls to do the graces at my fancy
ball."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of this mere whim of Lady Palliser's
arose a visiting acquaintance with the Ardens.</p>

<p>Alfred and Caroline were, therefore, more
than ever together, a consequence which Lady
Palliser made no effort whatever to prevent.
The fact was that her ladyship was in the habit
of considering Caroline, who was but seventeen,
a mere child; while her own excessive vanity,
and Alfred's unremitting efforts to make himself
agreeable to her for Caroline's sake, had completely
deceived her into a belief that he was
under the dominion of one of those absurd boy
passions, which very young men sometimes conceive
for women much older than themselves;
particularly if they happened to be, as her ladyship
well knew she was, still extremely beautiful.
And though Lady Palliser was too proud
and too cold to have the most remote idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
making a fool of herself, she looked forward to
seeing our hero in despair at her feet as to the
<i>denouement</i> of an excellent jest; while in the
meantime she amused herself by drawing him
on to commit every absurdity she could devise.
And such, no doubt, if meant as attentions to herself,
would have been many humble assiduities,
which, for Caroline's sake, he willingly paid her
ladyship.</p>

<p>During the progress of this amiable proceeding,
the honest-hearted Alfred received every
symptom of kindliness of manner, as an indication
of maternal feeling, and as a proof that
Lady Palliser already considered him her future
son-in-law.</p>

<p>One evening they happened to be alone, when
he was about to take his departure; her ladyship,
on bidding him good night, held towards him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
her beautiful white hand in a very coquettish,
but, as he thought, in the most frank, obliging
manner possible. The idea struck him, that
considering his comparative want of fortune, it
might be more honourable in him to make some
disclosure of the state of his feelings to Lady
Palliser, previously to addressing Caroline herself;
accordingly, in a paroxysm of grateful and dutiful
affection, he seized her ladyship's proffered
hand, respectfully pressed it to his lips, and began
to murmur something about his own unworthiness.
Lady Palliser, snatching her hand
away, laughed and said, "Go, you foolish child."</p>

<p>Alfred, thus discouraged for the moment, took
his departure in silence, with some idea that
Lady Palliser, however kindly and liberally
disposed towards his humble pretensions,
very possibly thought both Caroline and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
himself too young at present. What else could
she mean by calling him a foolish child? Little
did he dream of the construction put on his manner
by his intended mother-in-law.</p>

<p>As little had he suspected on former occasions,
that her ladyship had believed him to be making
a complete fool of himself, and had been in proportion
well amused, when, in conversation with
her, while every word was intended for the ear of
our heroine, who sat silently by at her drawing,
he had ventured on topics, which when alone with
Caroline he dared not introduce; and eloquently
painted his idea of an ardent, genuine, and worthy
attachment, and the devotion of a whole
life consequent upon it till he had became
breathless with agitation: yet, seeing that
Lady Palliser only smiled at the uncontrollable
warmth which quite carried him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
away, he believed that he was tacitly approved
of, and so thoroughly understood, that explanation,
whenever the proper time for it should
arrive, would be merely matter of form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>The triumphs of Aunt Dorothea over all
her enemies, particularly the Salters, were so
numerous, that to avoid prolixity we have not
recounted them. As for Miss Salter, she had
brought on a most inconvenient pain in the
back of her neck by the reiterated bows with
which she had again and again, morning after
morning, vainly endeavoured to draw the attention
of Mrs. Dorothea Arden.</p>

<p>One day, however, when that lady was driving
up and down the High-street, seated at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
ease in her sister, Lady Arden's peculiarly
splendid open barouche, she beheld, trudging
along the flag-way and coming towards her,
Mr. and the Misses Salter, with countenances
which betrayed that they were not insensible
to the heat of the weather; and shoes so
assimilated by dust to the dust on which
they trod, as to be nearly invisible. Mrs.
Dorothea was not aware that the Salters had
ever before seen her in this elegant carriage:
so anxious was she therefore that they should
do so now, that on the impulse of the moment,
in defiance of having long since given them the
cut direct, she made an almost involuntary, yet
very conspicuous bow. Electrified and delighted,
the whole party stopped short and performed no
less than three bows each in return; while
Miss Salter, who had by much the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
portion of moral courage of the whole trio,
added even a kiss of the hand.</p>

<p>Miss Dorothea had not been long returned
home when she received a card of invitation
from the Misses Salter to a quadrille party,
accompanied by a long servile note, to say
that they were much concerned at not having
had earlier it in their power to offer some
attention to her friends, Lady Arden and
family, and also to her friend Lady Palliser,
and begging to know if their waiting upon,
and sending cards of invitation to these respective
ladies would be agreeable.</p>

<p>To this was added a hint, that indeed the
party was in a great measure made for her
friends and would be very <i>select</i>.</p>

<p>To the invitation for herself, Mrs. Dorothea
sent a formal rejection, without assigning any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
reason. Of the absurd and forward proffer
of <i>attention</i> to her <i>friends</i> she took no notice.</p>

<p>Nor were those dignified proceedings the
sole mode of vengeance practised by Mrs.
Dorothea against her pitiful foes; for much
as she was herself engaged at present with
more agreeable occupations, she had placed
the affair from the commencement in such
able hands, namely, those of her prime minister,
Sarah, that no circumstance, however minute,
had been lost sight of.</p>

<p>The origin of the Salters, by its coarsest
appellation, had been diligently disseminated
in every servant's hall, and thence arisen to
the respective dining and drawing-rooms, till
it had reached the ears of many, who else had
never known that there were such people in
existence as the Salters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>What was if possible worse, Sir William
Orm's servant in particular had been put on
his guard about the deception practised on him
by Mrs. Johnson, respecting the young ladies'
fortunes; on which Sir William had without
the slightest ceremony cut the connexion altogether.
He never called or even left a card;
he never joined them any where, and as to the
bows he gave them in return for those they
made to him from a mile off, they were really,
except to persons in desperate circumstances,
not worth having.</p>

<p>Sir James, it may be remembered, had deserted
on the very first morning he had encountered
Louisa Arden; so that disconsolate
indeed were now the pair who had so lately
congratulated themselves on having two
baronets for their lovers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>Their <i>select</i> acquaintance too, the Shawbridges
and Whaleworthys, began to play
fine; for in a watering place a title is a title,
whether got by accident or by cheese, and though
both beef and cheese, like all other necessaries,
are sad vulgar things, experience had taught
even the innocent hearted Lady Whaleworthy,
that with a certain class, and she poor woman
dreamed of no better, a title could cover a
multitude of <i>cheeses</i>.</p>

<p>Not so, alas, with the Misses Salter's <i>family
secret</i>, which seemed for the present to have
abolished all variety of diet, for (crying injustice!)
while scarcely any body would visit
Mr. Salter, Mr. Salter's beef was, to quote
Sarah's polite pun, "in every body's mouth!"</p>

<p>People could not even propound the flattering
probability of his having amassed a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
fortune without some one more witty than
elegant adding the characteristic remark, that
while salting his beef it was supposed he had
taken care to save his bacon.</p>

<p>To complete the unfortunate position of the
family, Mr. Salter had unluckily found it
necessary of late, in consequence of an aggravation
of his old complaint of the eyelids, to
wear, protruding from beneath the brim of his
white hat, a <i>green</i> silk shade, which gave occasion
to the idlers on the Mountpelier-walk,
green being the well known colour of disappointment,
to assert that he had done so in
consequence of the cruel desertion of Lady
Flamborough, who had, simultaneously with
the appearance of the said badge of despair,
jilted him for a half-pay lieutenant; a gentleman
who having received a hint to retire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
from the service of his Majesty, for reasons
best known to himself and his brother officers,
had come to Cheltenham to devote himself to
the service of the ladies.</p>

<p>Nor had poor Mr. Salter, while dragged
every day to the walks by his daughters, who
now had no one else to walk with, a chance
of forgetting his fair deceiver; for there she
was to be seen morning and evening as gaily
<i>undressed</i> as ever, flaunting away and smiling
and languishing as usual; her white ostrich
feathers too, at the highly improper instigation
of the breezes, mingling from time to time with
the bright red whiskers of the ci-devant
lieutenant; while she, ungrateful woman, had
the barbarity to pass poor Mr. Salter again
and again, without so much as a recognition.
"And that after," as he himself remarked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
"having had the face to eat his good dinners;"
the remembrance of the cost of which now
added bitterness to the thoughts of slighted
love.</p>

<p>This was the morning too of the very day,
or rather evening, fixed for Lady Palliser's
fancy ball, with the expectation of which the
whole town was ringing. Even the walks
were thinned by its prospective influence, or
rather picked of fashionables; for those who
were to be there, were keeping themselves up,
that they might be quite fresh for an occasion
to which the very capriciousness of her ladyship's
character had lent, in anticipation at
least, a more than common interest.</p>

<p>The Misses Salter, after weighing for two or
three turns the poor chance which sad experience
had taught them there was of their picking up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
beau of any kind, against the certain disgrace
of showing by their wretchedness of fatigue
that they were not to be among the <i>lite</i> of the
evening, decided on going home to their
breakfast, which social meal commenced in a
sulk and ended in a storm.</p>

<p>Miss Grace began again about the improvidence
of cutting Mrs. Dorothea in the premature
manner they had done. "And it was
all your fault, Eliza," she continued, "that insolent
temper of yours is always longing so for
an opportunity to break out; and yet there is
nobody that can sneak and cringe in the mean
fawning manner that you can when you think
there is any thing to be got by a person. If
my advice had been taken, we would have been
acquainted with all these genteel people, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
going to this ball to-night, no doubt. To do
Mrs. Dorothea justice, she was quite indefatigable
in her kindness, and in getting
people to call on us and invite us as long as we
showed her any kind of gratitude; so we have
ourselves to thank, or rather you for it all."</p>

<p>"Your advice indeed, you fool!" was all
Miss Salter could find to say; having, as she
could not help knowing, the worst of the
argument.</p>

<p>"It all comes of <i>pride</i>, and upstartishness,
and nonsense," said Mr. Salter. "Grace, the
girl, however, is so far right; Mrs. Dorothea
Arden is a very worthy gentlewoman, and
showed us a great deal more civility than in
our station of life we had any right to look
for; and it certainly was our place to be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
grateful for it, and if we have not been so it
is no fault of mine; I knew nothing of the
carryings on of you Misses with your boarding-school
breeding forsooth."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p>In consequence of the expected ball in the
evening, neither the Palliser nor Arden party had
been at the walks in the morning. But soon
after breakfast Alfred called at Lady Palliser's
with his usual offering of sweets.</p>

<p>Caroline had just entered the drawing-room,
and was proceeding towards a conservatory at
its further extremity, when the appearance of
Alfred arrested her steps.</p>

<p>He assisted her in arranging the flowers he
had brought, and in selecting from them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
favoured few she was to wear herself. This
task drew from him some playful remark, more
love-like than rational, on the good fortune of
the happy blossoms thus chosen.</p>

<p>Lady Palliser had been particularly harsh
that morning about some trifle, and Caroline
was consequently in very bad spirits.</p>

<p>"Why should it be good fortune to be chosen
by me," she said, "when I am myself the most
unfortunate of beings? The poor flowers that
I choose," she added with a faint effort to laugh,
fearful she had said too much, "will be the
first to fade away," quoting Moore's little
song.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Or the young gazelle, with its soft black eye,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If it <i>loved you well would be sure to die</i>,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>proceeded Alfred, humming the air and continuing
the quotation; then in a half playful, half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
tender whisper, he subjoined, "The death-warrant
of many of whom your ladyship little
thinks would be already signed and sealed were
this the case." But perceiving while he spoke
that though Caroline tried to smile her lip trembled,
he checked himself, and with an altered
tone exclaimed, "I beg a thousand pardons!
You are&mdash;you seem&mdash;what can have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," she replied, "only other
young people are light-hearted and cheerful
together; there are your sisters for instance,
how happy they always seem to be; and how
kind to you all&mdash;how indulgent, how affectionate,
Lady Arden appears. While I have
neither sister, nor brother, and yet my mother"&mdash;here
checking herself, she added hesitatingly,
"I dare say&mdash;it must be my own fault&mdash;I suppose
I don't deserve to be loved&mdash;but I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
quite sure that&mdash;that&mdash;my mother does not love
me&mdash;and oh, if you knew how miserable the
thought makes me!"</p>

<p>"You cannot be serious," he said.</p>

<p>"I am indeed!" she replied, looking up
with innocent earnestness, while her eyes swam
in tears.</p>

<p>Alfred caught her hand, pressed it to his lips,
talked incoherently about the impossibility of
knowing without loving her, then of his own
unworthiness, his presumption, his poverty, his
insignificance, &amp;c. &amp;c.; his being in short a
younger son; and at length wound up all by
making, notwithstanding, a passionate declaration
of his love. If affection the most devoted,
the most unalterable, had any value in her eyes,
affection that would study her every wish,
affection such as he was convinced no lover had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
ever felt before; if such affection could in any
degree compensate for the absence of every
other pretension, such, unable longer to suppress
his feeling, he now ventured to lay at her feet.</p>

<p>Caroline trembled and remained silent. He
entreated her to speak, to relieve him from
the fear that he had offended her past forgiveness
by the very mention of his perhaps too
daring suit.</p>

<p>"Does&mdash;my mother&mdash;know?" she whispered
at last, "because&mdash;if not&mdash;I fear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lady Palliser I think," he replied, "must
know, must understand; nay, I have ventured
to allude slightly to the subject, and have even
been presumptuous enough to translate her
ladyship's kindly and indulgent admission of
my constant visits as, however liberal on her
part, a tacit consent to my addresses."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I hope you are right!" exclaimed Caroline,
with an inadvertent earnestness which called
forth from Alfred gratitude the most profuse, expressed,
not indeed loudly, but in whispers so tender,
so eloquent, that for some moments, Caroline,
forgetting every thing but their import, felt
a happiness she had never known before. New
and delightful prospects of futurity seemed
opening before her youthful imagination, hitherto
so cruelly depressed. Her countenance,
though covered with blushes, and studiously
turned away to hide them, so far indicated what
was passing within, as to encourage Alfred in
adding,</p>

<p>"To-morrow, then, when Lady Palliser may
possibly be at home, may I venture to speak to
her ladyship on this subject?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>After a short silence, Caroline replied with
hesitation,</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I&mdash;suppose&mdash;you had better."</p>

<p>But she sighed heavily as she said so, for she
dreaded the strange and whimsical temper of
Lady Palliser; yet she now found that a feeling
of consolation accompanied what had hitherto
been her greatest sorrow, the sense of her
mother's want of affection; for perhaps, she
thought, she may not care enough about me
to mind what I do! Here all her efforts at self-possession
gave way, and she yielded to a passion
of tears.</p>

<p>Alfred had been holding her hand, and anxiously
watching her countenance; he became
alarmed, and began to suspect, that perhaps
she was herself undecided. "What can this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
mean?" he cried. "You do not repent of the
permission you have given me? Caroline!
say you do not! Say I am wrong in this!"</p>

<p>She raised her eyes and moved her lips to
reply, when a loud electrifying knock was heard
at the hall door. The look however had so far
reassured Alfred, that he again pressed her
hand to his lips, and repeated with an inquiring
tone, "To-morrow, then?" Footsteps were heard
in the hall; the drawing-room door opened, and
Alfred hastily disappeared, while a servant entering,
laid cards on the table and retired.</p>

<p>Caroline was hastening towards the conservatory
to take refuge there till her agitation
should subside, when the Venetian blind which
hung over its entrance was moved aside, and her
mother appeared before her, scorn and rage depicted
in her countenance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>Our heroine, her footsteps thus unexpectedly
arrested, stopped short in the centre of the
apartment, and stood trembling from head to
foot.</p>

<p>From behind the Venetian blind, Lady Palliser
had witnessed the whole of the interview
between the lovers.</p>

<p>She was not herself previously aware that the
heartless coquetry in which she had been indulging
had taken so strong a hold even of her
bad feelings; but disappointed vanity was perhaps
a mortification she had never known before.
She therefore scarcely herself understood
the species of rage with which she was now
animated; the almost hatred with which she
now looked on the perfect loveliness of her
blushing, trembling child. Of course, on prudential
considerations she would have disap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>proved
of the match at any rate; and of this
she now made an excuse to herself.</p>

<p>She stepped forward, and when close before
Caroline, stamped her foot, uttered an ironical,
hysterical laugh, and almost gasping for breath,
stood some moments ere she could well articulate.</p>

<p>"You piece of premature impudence!" were
the first words she at length pronounced. After
pausing again for a moment, she recommenced
with a sneer, "So you have made your arrangement.
I must congratulate you on Mr. Arden's
obliging acceptance of your liberal offer, of
heart, hand, and fortune!"</p>

<p>Caroline looked the most innocent astonishment.</p>

<p>"You really do not understand me," proceeded
her ladyship, in the same tone of mock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>ery.
"Are you then not aware that I have been
a witness to the scene which has just passed?
and have, of course, heard your modest ladyship
stating to Mr. Arden how much at a loss
you were for some one to love you, forsooth!
Barefaced enough, certainly! Upon which the
young man could not in common politeness do
less than offer his services. Besides, it was
much too good a thing to be rejected; few
younger brothers, and therefore beggars, would
refuse the hand of an heiress of your rank and
fortune. Go! you disgrace to your family and
sex; go to your room, and remain there till you
have my permission to leave it. As for Mr.
Arden, I shall give orders that he is never again
admitted beneath this roof. Should you hereafter
meet him in society do not dare to recognise
him. Go!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Caroline was moving towards the door, without
attempting a reply, well aware that remonstrance
or entreaty would be perfectly vain.</p>

<p>"Stay!&mdash;I have changed my mind," recommenced
her ladyship. "Mr. Arden comes to-morrow,
it seems&mdash;let him come&mdash;I shall not
see him. Receive him yourself, reject him yourself,
now and for ever! Tell him that on reflection
you have repented of your folly; and that
the subject must not be even mentioned to me.
Let the interview take place in this room&mdash;let
your rejection be distinct, and let him suppose
it comes from yourself. I shall be again
in the conservatory&mdash;I shall hear and see all
that passes; and on your peril, by word or look,
say more or less than I have commanded."</p>

<p>Caroline flung herself on her knees, and with
clasped hands and streaming eyes looked up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
her mother's face. "Oh, do not, do not," she
exclaimed, "ask me to see him, and in all else
I will submit!"</p>

<p>Lady Palliser laughed out with malicious
irony, saying, "So you offer conditional obedience.
Do," she proceeded, frowning fiercely,
and extending her clenched hand in the attitude
of a fury, "precisely as I have commanded!"</p>

<p>"This evening," continued her ladyship, with
affected composure, looking contemptuously
down on Caroline, who was sobbing ready to
break her heart, "this evening, deport yourself
as though nothing had happened: dance as
much as usual; and do not dare to have red
eyes, or to show the slightest depression of manner.
Should Mr. Arden make any allusion to
what has occurred this morning, merely tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
him to say nothing more on the subject till to-morrow."</p>

<p>Here Lady Palliser quitted the apartment,
while Caroline remained on her knees, overwhelmed
by utter despair, and shedding, with
all the innocent vehemence of childhood, the
large pure tears, which like summer showers fall
so abundantly from the eyes of the young in
their first sorrow.</p>

<p>The alternative of daring to disobey her harsh
and heartless mother never once presented itself
to her mind as possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<p>It was night&mdash;arrivals had commenced&mdash;the
lights, the music, the decorations, the sight and
scent of the flowers, all added to the aching of
Caroline's temples and the confusion of her
ideas, as she stood in a sort of waking dream,
conscious only of wretchedness, near the door
of the first of the reception rooms, courtesying
with a mechanical smile to each new group that
appeared. She would have given the world to
have been any where else, but this was the post
her mother had commanded her to fill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>When the ladies of the Arden party entered,
she felt a childish impulse to fling herself into
the bosom of Lady Arden, and drawing all the
daughters round her, entreat them to hide her
from her cruel mother.</p>

<p>Alfred next appeared, accompanied by Sir
Willoughby and Mr. Geoffery Arden. The
two latter named gentlemen had been expected
for some days, but had arrived only about two
hours before.</p>

<p>Alfred presented both, and some unmeaning
conversation passed about the heat of London,
how long they had been on the road, &amp;c. Our
hero, the moment he came in, missed the flowers
Caroline had promised to wear, and felt disappointed.
If she had forgotten them in the
hurry of dressing it was no very flattering token
of her regard. If, on the other hand, Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Palliser had noticed and forbid her wearing
them, it was a bad symptom of his ultimate
success. He longed for an opportunity of venturing
some playful reproach which might lead
to an explanation. When his companions moved
on a step or two he drew very near, and asked
in an emphatic whisper, if the chosen blossoms
had faded already. A rush of colour, which the
peculiar fairness of Caroline's complexion already
described made the more remarkable,
covered her cheeks in a moment; but she attempted
no reply. After a short and somewhat
anxious pause Alfred asked her to dance; she
looked up suddenly but vacantly, as if scarcely
comprehending what he had said, but still spoke
not. He was just about to repeat his words,
when Willoughby, who had been conversing
with Lady Palliser, turned round and made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
same request. Caroline, glancing towards her
mother, and seeing her eye upon her, started,
assented quickly, took Willoughby's arm, and
walked to the quadrille.</p>

<p>Lady Palliser noted the chagrin of our hero
with secret triumph, and suddenly forming one
of her usually whimsical and tyrannical resolves,
determined, as an appropriate punishment for
the lovers, to marry her daughter to Sir Willoughby,
whose match in town she had heard
it confidently reported was off. Though he
was but a baronet, his immense property made
it at least an eligible marriage; and such, little
as she cared about Caroline, she had always
considered it a necessary part of etiquette some
time or other to provide.</p>

<p>That Alfred, however, might ascribe Caroline's
change to her own caprice, and be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
more mortified, Lady Palliser took his arm,
walked about with him for a considerable time,
and treated him with more than her usual
cordiality.</p>

<p>It had the desired effect, it threw him into
complete despair; he could not now even console
himself with the thought that Caroline was
acting under the influence of her mother.</p>

<p>When the dancing had ceased, and Caroline
was seated with her evidently delighted partner
on a distant sofa, Lady Palliser led our hero up
to her, and said, "Come, Caroline, I have no
notion of giving up old friends for new ones
altogether: you must dance one set with poor
Alfred; do see how forlorn he looks."</p>

<p>Caroline was utterly confounded: had her
mother forgiven them&mdash;was she going to relent.</p>

<p>Such happy thoughts, however, were soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
scattered, for Lady Palliser, on pretext of arranging
a stray ringlet, drawing very near,
whispered, with a menacing frown, "Take care
how you behave, and what you say." The
frown and whisper destroying as they did the
momentary hope, caused Caroline, on taking
Alfred's arm, to look so much disappointed that
it was impossible not to infer that she would
rather have remained on the sofa. Yet Alfred
could not bring himself to believe this! he was
miserable, however, and did not know what to
think; while he was so much occupied forming
painful conjectures, that he himself behaved
strangely and coldly.</p>

<p>Caroline thought with intense agony of the
task she had to perform in the morning, while
with a feeling allied to terror she stole from
time to time a momentary glance at the features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
of him she must so soon mortally offend; to
whom she must so soon give apparently just
cause to view her henceforward with hatred
and contempt. She even fancied that his countenance
wore already a severity of expression
she had never seen in it before. She bewildered
herself too with the thought, that if she
could get an opportunity and venture just to
whisper, "Mr. Arden, don't mind any thing
I am obliged to say to you in the morning," it
might prevent his thinking so very very ill of
her as he must otherwise do. This sentence
she repeated to herself above an hundred times
during the quadrille, yet whenever she was
going to address it to Alfred, and more than
once she moved her lips to begin, she either
caught her mother's eye turned upon her, or
she fancied it might be, and dared not look to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
see lest it should give her a conscious and
guilty appearance; or the impression that Alfred
was already displeased became so strong
as to deprive her of the courage to speak to
him; besides all which, her heart at each
abortive attempt she made to articulate, leaped
up into her throat, and by its excessive fluttering
quite choked her utterance, till the convenient
moment was gone by. On the music
ceasing, Lady Palliser came up and took her
away, as if in great haste to make some arrangement,
yet, in so obliging a manner, and
with so many pretty excuses, that Alfred
thought her ladyship at least was unchanged.</p>

<p>And so must Caroline, he told himself again
and again; "it can be but fancy on my part, or
rather, all that seems strange and altered in
her manner must proceed from her extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
delicacy, her excessive timidity, her consciousness
that we now perfectly understand each
other's thoughts makes her fearful to meet my
eye, at least with others present; makes her
afraid that all the world will know the moment
they see us together what is passing in our hearts.
I can well imagine one so gentle, so young, so
fearful, feeling the newness of her situation,
almost as though she were already a bride;
having listened but this very morning, for the
first time in her life, I should suppose favourably,
to the accent of a lover."</p>

<p>Alfred had wandered into the conservatory,
where, amid the intoxicating odours of ten thousand
exotics&mdash;pursuing this train of thought&mdash;he
luxuriated for a time in dream-like meditations
on the delicacy, the devotion, the exclusive
tenderness, which must necessarily charac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>terise
the attachment of a being so pure, so
innocent, so unpractised in the world's ways
as Caroline&mdash;his Caroline! Yes, he was now
entitled to combine with her idea this endearing
epithet.</p>

<p>He was standing the while with his arms
folded and his eyes unconsciously uplifted to a
brilliant lamp, as if lost in contemplation of
its brightness.</p>

<p>A change in the music broke his reverie;
when his discerning vision passing along a
vista of orange trees, found its way into the
drawing-room, and fell on a group preparing to
waltz. Among these, and occupying the very
spot hallowed to memory by the interview of
the morning, he beheld Caroline standing with
the arm of Willoughby round her slender waist,
and her hand resting on his shoulder&mdash;a mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>ment
after the couple had launched amid the
tide of changing forms; but Alfred's eye still
traced them as they floated round and round
the prescribed circle, till, what with the moving
scene, and his own thoughts of agony, his brain
went round also. He had never been able to prevail
with Caroline to waltz, her plea of refusal
had always been that she did not waltz. Was
she then changed in every sentiment&mdash;in every
opinion&mdash;in every feeling! Had she become
hardened to the world&mdash;lost to personal delicacy&mdash;lost
to affection&mdash;lost to him! What had
she&mdash;what had she not become! and all within
a few short hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p>In vain had our heroine, when Sir Willoughby
had asked her to waltz, pleaded the same excuse
alluded to in our last chapter. Lady Palliser,
who was near, and heard Sir Willoughby's
request, interfered, and commanded compliance;
while poor Caroline, who seems to have been
born but to be the victim of her mother's caprices,
was led away to join the gay circle,
trembling and broken-hearted.</p>

<p>The report that Willoughby's marriage had been
broken off was quite true: he had written the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
account to Alfred a day or two before. The
lady had the very day previous to that fixed for
the wedding eloped with her former lover; while
Sir Willoughby had found himself, his preparations
being all made, in rather an absurd situation.</p>

<p>The newspapers, too, had taken unwarrantable
liberties with his name, and made some
witty comments on the superior personal attractions
of his rival.</p>

<p>His vanity it was which had in the first instance
been gratified&mdash;his vanity now suffered
proportionately. And so irritable was his temper
and so depressed his spirits, on his arrival in
Cheltenham, that Alfred, who had but just returned
from his interview with Caroline, felt
that it would be mistimed to mention her, or
allude at all at present to his own happier pros<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>pects.
He limited the confidential conversation,
therefore, to kind condolence with his
brother, being too delicate to remind Willoughby
that he might have escaped this mortification
had he taken his advice.</p>

<p>Thus was the foundation unintentionally laid
of a concealment which finally led to many disastrous
consequences.</p>

<p>The moment Willoughby was introduced to
Caroline he was captivated by her beauty. After
they had danced together, when our heroine
was so unexpectedly desired by her mother to
dance with Alfred, Geoffery Arden, who may be
termed Willoughby's evil genius, took possession
of the seat beside him on the sofa, which
had been just vacated by Caroline; and well
knowing his cousin's weak point, said, "Well,
that is one of the most pointed things I ever saw."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"To what do you allude?" asked Willoughby.</p>

<p>"Did you not see how mortified her ladyship
looked at having her flirtation with you disturbed."</p>

<p>"Flirtation, indeed!" repeated Willoughby,
laughing; "the acquaintance is rather short for
that, I should think."</p>

<p>"Nay, we hear of love at first sight; and it
was certainly something very like it. You were
not many minutes in the room when you asked
Lady Caroline to dance; and I don't know
whether you noticed it, but a moment or two
before Alfred, who has been so long acquainted,
had made the same request; the lady pretended
not to hear: she heard, however, when you
spoke, and consented with marked alacrity."</p>

<p>Willoughby's vanity, which had been so lately
wounded, gladly welcomed suggestions so flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>tering.
To woo and win the young, the beautiful,
the rich Lady Caroline Montague, might
well silence the jeers of those who were disposed
to make impertinent comments on his late
disappointment.</p>

<p>As for Geoffery Arden's motive for offering
the incense of flattery to Willoughby, it was the
same which in most cases governs most men&mdash;self-interest.
It was by the grossest flattery
that he had long since made himself necessary
to his cousin; and by the same means he still
sought to retain an influence over him, which,
in a pecuniary point of view, was particularly
convenient to himself. On the present occasion
also, he had seen with half a glance sufficient
to make him suspect, at least, that Lady Caroline
Montague was an object of interest to
Alfred. If he was right in his conjecture, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
circumstance might afford a favourable opportunity
for sowing the seeds of dissension between
the brothers, an object of which he never
lost sight, well knowing that his own influence
and that of Alfred could never go hand in hand&mdash;the
one being for evil, the other for good.</p>

<p>Added to this, it was always more or less an
object with him to throw obstacles in the way
of any love affair of either of the brothers; for
though he was not so romantic as to expect by
such means to succeed in preserving them both
old bachelors, should they reach old age&mdash;for
such a chance could not be very important
to him, who was so much their senior&mdash;it
was just as well to keep the book of fate
open as long as possible. There was no use
in increasing the chances against himself.
The fewer names, in short, above his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
on the list of even improbable advantages the
better.</p>

<p>While the cousins continued to occupy their
sofa, and observe the dancers, Geoffery was eloquent
in the praises of Caroline's beauty; quoting,
as he well might, many high authorities for
her being the acknowledged belle of the late
season in town. He knew that weak men, with
all their obstinate devotion to their own opinions,
unconsciously see with the eyes, hear with the
ears, and even speak in the language of others;
and that their love most especially is a mere
reflection!</p>

<p>Indeed, to gain an entire ascendency over
weak people only requires a little management;
but unfortunately it is of that uncandid sort
which their best friends are the least likely to
adopt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>If you say to an ill-governed child, "My
dear, you have eaten enough of that cake, give
it me, and take this pretty toy to play with."
The child says, "No, I won't; it's not a pretty
toy," and eats faster than before. But lay
down the toy carelessly within his sight, and if
he has eaten sufficiently, he will drop his cake
on the floor, and fly to seize the toy.</p>

<p>Men and women of weak minds are but children
of a larger growth.</p>

<p>When the company had all retired, Lady
Palliser thus addressed her daughter: "Your
avoiding to dance with Mr. Arden was quite
unnecessary. I have no desire that your manners
towards him in society should be at all
altered: such conduct would draw down remarks
which I do not choose should be made.
As for to-morrow," continued her ladyship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
"remember that I shall witness the scene;
therefore let your obedience be perfect! Also,
if you have any regard to decency left, take
care that no folly on your part gives Mr. Arden
an opportunity of boasting that Lady Caroline
Montague, in despite of the impropriety of the
alliance, was indelicately ready to fling herself
into his arms, if Lady Palliser had not interfered."</p>

<p>Her ladyship here quitted the room; and
Caroline, her ideas confused by this new view
of the subject, stood transfixed to the spot,
till aroused from her reverie by the entrance of
servants to extinguish the lights.</p>

<p>She retired, but it may be believed not to
rest. She flung herself on her bed without undressing,
and wept away the early morning, the
brightness of which entering freely through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
shutterless windows of a Cheltenham bed-room,
shone with incongruous lustre alike on her glittering
ornaments and her falling tears. We
speak of morning, because the night, of course,
had been over before the ball concluded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>


<p>Alfred had no opportunity for private conversation
with his brother before he went to
his appointment at Lady Palliser's; nor indeed
did he now desire it till he should have come
to some explanation with Caroline.</p>

<p>In strange perplexity of spirits, trying in
vain to persuade himself that he had every thing
to hope and nothing to fear, he repaired to Jessamine
Bower.</p>

<p>On entering the drawing-room he perceived
Caroline, seated and alone. When he was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>nounced,
she did not move. He approached;
her eyes still remained fixed on the ground,
while the paleness of her complexion was
even more remarkable than usual, and a
very slight but universal tremor pervaded her
whole frame. He stood before her, and as he
did so, trembled himself with undefined apprehension.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Caroline!" he exclaimed,
sinking on one knee, and attempting to take her
hand. She withdrew it hastily, and her cheeks
crimsoned while she cast one involuntary glance
in the direction of the conservatory. Alfred
rose, folded his arms, and stood for a moment
silent, then said&mdash;"If I have been presumptuous,
Lady Caroline, I have much to plead in
my excuse, and the interview of yesterday in
particular; I was certainly led to hope for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
more favourable reception, however little I may
be deserving of it."</p>

<p>"I was&mdash;to blame," said Caroline, in a voice
scarcely articulate, and still without looking up.</p>

<p>"Is it possible! Do I interpret you right?
Were those hopes, to me so full of joy, altogether
fallacious? But no, Caroline, I will not,
I cannot believe it! Lady Palliser objects, and
you deem it your duty to submit: even this
thought would be happiness, compared with
that of your indifference! Or&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My caprice!" said Caroline, looking up almost
wildly for a moment, "Yes, think it my
caprice!"</p>

<p>"I cannot believe it," he replied.</p>

<p>There was a considerable pause, during which
he anxiously observed Caroline, and perceived
that silent tears were stealing down her cheeks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those tears are not caused by caprice," he
said in a tone of tenderness; "in compassion
say," he added with sudden and vehement earnestness,
"that you are acting in obedience to
Lady Palliser's commands, and I too will submit."
While speaking again he sank on his knee
before her, and tried to take both her hands.
The terror however with which she resisted, hastily
rising as she did so&mdash;the more effectually to
avoid him&mdash;so much for the moment resembled
aversion, that he rose as hastily, and looking his
amazement, said with a hysterical intonation of
voice, "If it is indeed so, I have a thousand
apologies to offer to Lady Caroline Montague
for my impertinent intrusiveness. To retire,
however, and offend no more, will perhaps be
better than entering further into the subject."
He was about to depart, when pausing he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
"I will ask one question&mdash;Am I rejected? Do
you finally withdraw the hopes you yesterday
bestowed?"</p>

<p>"I do," she replied.</p>

<p>He stood for a few moments to master his
emotion, then pronouncing a haughty good morning,
hastily quitted the room and the house.
In a few moments after, he was pacing, without
plan or intention, one of the many shady
and usually quite solitary walks, which branch
off in every direction from the general scene
of gaiety, and near to which both villas stood.</p>

<p>His pride, as well as every tenderer and worthier
feeling, was wounded beyond description.
He now appeared, even to himself, in the light
of one who had indelicately, unfeelingly, and
presumptuously sought a match of worldly advantage,
to which he had no pretension; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
though he could acquit himself of interested
views in so doing, he felt that it would be a romance
and absurdity to expect so candid an interpretation
from any one else. The one continued
dream, which had made up his whole
existence for many weeks past, was now dissipated
in an instant. Nay, he sought in vain
among his own meditations for the apologies,
even to himself, which had before seemed
sufficient. Caroline, so silent, so fearful at
the commencement of their acquaintance, had
seemed to derive a new existence from his
growing attentions, while Lady Palliser, instead
of checking those attentions, and showing
alarm at the visible pleasure with which her
daughter received them, had herself given him
what he then considered the most unequivocal
encouragement, being always the first to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
intercourse easy to both, by desiring the always
timid Caroline to dance with him, walk with
him, and sing with him. And then the silent
glow of secret pleasure with which the welcome
command was obeyed, confirmed sometimes
perhaps by a momentary expression caught
when the eyes accidentally met, or at other
times merely by an alacrity of movement, or
cheerfulness of tone in obeying or replying,
which, notwithstanding, betrayed volumes in a
character too fearful and gentle to let itself be
regularly read aloud, yet too artless, too unpractised,
to know how utterly to seal its
pages.</p>

<p>While such things had been, the prejudices
of society had faded from his mind; he had
believed it not impossible that where an only
child already possessed immense estates, a pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>rent
might prefer the happiness of that child to
the unnecessary addition of other estates. Now
all the artificial estimates of life and manners,
taught by early education, returned in their
fullest force, and he thought himself a madman
ever to have entertained such an opinion.</p>

<p>He now believed that every one who knew
he had had the presumption to pay his addresses
to Lady Caroline Montague, would reprobate
him and say, that because he was a
younger brother, and of course a beggar, he
wanted to make his fortune by marrying an
heiress. How bitterly did he now regret that
he had ever had the rash folly to confess his
passion. Yet, so thoroughly disinterested had
that passion been, that he had even for the
time lost sight of the possibility of being suspected
by others of motives of which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
himself incapable: all that through the happy
intoxication of his feelings had presented itself
respecting fortune, was a vaguely delightful
remembrance that his poverty could never entail
any privations on Caroline. What was
now to be done? The wretched state of his
feelings would have induced him to quit
Cheltenham immediately, but wounded pride
prompted him to remain; he wished to let
Lady Caroline Montague see that her caprices
should not govern his conduct; that he could
behave with composure in her society&mdash;with
polite self-possession even towards herself.
But in this first moment of just resentment,
he knew not the difficulty of the task he courted.
He resolved to conceal the whole affair from
Willoughby, and if his mother and sisters persisted
in making allusion to the subject of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
admiration of Lady Caroline Montague, to assure
them gravely that he never meant, in
his circumstances, to subject himself to the suspicion
of seeking an heiress because she was an
heiress.</p>

<p>Having come to so dignified a resolve, he
flattered himself for the moment that he was
almost composed. Scarcely however had he
arrived at this conclusion, than fond memory,
more at leisure than it had been during the late
angry burst of disappointed passion, began retracing
scenes, recalling looks, repeating words,
recounting circumstances, till his mind again
became a troubled sea, from amidst the breakers
of which he beheld, but now with all the
aggravated feelings of one sent adrift in a bark
without rudder or oar, tantalizing views, but
too distant to admit a hope of reaching a smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
happy shore&mdash;a haven of bliss to fancy's eye,
which appeared the more perfect now that it
was unattainable.</p>

<p>At one time he stopped short, and stood for
about ten minutes like an absolute statue, quite
unconscious of any outward object. He was
asking himself, if it were not still possible that
Caroline was acting under the influence of Lady
Palliser and if there might not come a time when
that influence would cease?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>


<p>No language can paint the utter desolation of
poor Caroline's mind; for she was too young,
too inexperienced, too much accustomed from
infancy, to be the unmurmuring slave of her
mother's capricious tyranny to have any thing
like a just estimate of her own situation.</p>

<p>Had she ventured to think, which she had
never yet done, that when of age she should be
her own mistress, she would, as very young
people do when they look forward three or four
years, have thought the period so remote as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
be scarcely an object of hope; while she would
still have trembled at the thought of venturing
at any time, however distant, to disobey her
mother, unless indeed she could be quite sure
of never seeing her again.</p>

<p>Lady Palliser's plan of government when
Caroline was a mere infant, had been a system
of terror; nor had any thing in her subsequent
conduct tended to soften that first impression.
Frowns and menacing attitudes had been used
towards the baby before it could understand
words, if when occasionally brought into its
mother's presence it had happened to stretch
its little hand towards any attractive object.
Hours of solitary imprisonment in a dark room
had been inflicted on the child, for but a fancied
dilatoriness of movement in the execution
of a command, till poor Caroline had learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
to start with nervous alarm, and fly with the
alacrity of terror at the very sound of her mother's
voice; while it was melancholy to see,
during the seemingly willing movement the
little innocent face of the child filled with the
contradictory expressions of anxiety and dread.</p>

<p>Thus had early associations followed up by
constant tyranny, imposed at the dictates of a
temper unreasonable, capricious, and unfeeling,
taught Caroline to view with a sinking of the
heart the very smiles of her mother's countenance,
as played off in company; none of them
she knew were intended for her, even when
their light, perchance, was turned upon her.</p>

<p>Overweening, all-engrossing vanity, was Lady
Palliser's ruling passion; society therefore in
which she could be the object of universal admiration
was her only element. Not that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
was what is commonly called a flirt:&mdash;she was
too haughty&mdash;too exacting of general adoration
for such a condescension towards any individual
in particular; while yet within her
hidden thoughts, concealed beneath an appearance
of statue-like coldness, she had a secret
delight in imagining every man with whom she
was acquainted, as much in love with her as he
dared to be, and withheld from a declaration of his
passion only by her own haughty reserve: nay,
so far did she carry this dream of vanity, that
she felt more or less of resentment towards every
man of her acquaintance who married or attached
himself to any other woman.</p>

<p>Such was the person with whom poor
Caroline had hitherto spent every domestic
hour she could remember. Her home, which
had thus never been a happy one, now by con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>trast
with the vague hopes in which she had
latterly ventured to indulge, presented to her
imagination a long perspective of tenfold dreariness.
The frowns in private, the artificial
smiles in public of her unkind parent, were
all that she anticipated in future. Her very
youth seemed an aggravation of her misery,
for the grave itself, which, in her present
exaggerated and hopeless state of feeling,
was she believed, the only refuge to which
she could look forward, appeared at an immeasurable
distance, the path to it stretching
before her mind's eye an interminable pilgrimage
of weariness.</p>

<p>We do not mean to support these views of
the subject as rational or just; but Caroline
in experience and knowledge of the world, as
well as in chancery phraseology, was still an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
infant; even her love had at present something
in it of the feelings of the child turning to the
kind and gentle, as a refuge from the harshness
of the more severe; and with the idea of
Alfred was blended thoughts of his sisters and
of Lady Arden, and of their happy home&mdash;that
scene of cheerfulness and general goodwill,
which she had latterly enjoyed the privilege of
entering without ceremony, and which she had
never quitted without regret.</p>

<p>The most severe, however, of all her sufferings
was the thought that Alfred must now
hate and despise her.</p>

<p>She was shut up in her own apartment
weeping bitterly and giving way to a succession
of dreary reflections, when she received a summons
from her mother to appear in the drawing-room.
So much was she accustomed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
obey implicitly that she did not dare to excuse
herself.</p>

<p>On descending, she found with Lady Palliser,
Sir Willoughby Arden and his cousin
Geoffery. Willoughby was turning over new
songs and professing himself a great admirer
of music; the true secret of which was that
he sang remarkably well himself. After some
trivial conversation, he discovered several duets
in which he had often taken a part with his
sisters, and intreated that Caroline would try
one of them. She excused herself on the plea
of a headache caused by the music, lights,
and late hours of the previous evening; but
Lady Palliser interfering, she was compelled to
make a wretched attempt; the manner spiritless,
the voice tremulous and even out of tune.
Willoughby's performance, however, was really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
good; he was therefore quite delighted. As
the song was being concluded, Lady and the
Misses Arden came in, and the latter being
prevailed on to assist Willoughby with some
more of his favourite duets, the visit was prolonged
into quite a morning concert.</p>

<p>When the Ardens were about to take
their departure for the avowed purpose of a
walk, Lady Palliser insisted on Caroline's accompanying
them, saying that the air would
take away her headache. Caroline made a
faint effort to excuse herself, but in this, as in
every thing, was obliged to submit.</p>

<p>They soon met and were joined by Lord
Darlingford and Sir James Lindsey; and it
not being an hour at which any part of the
walks was particularly crowded, they wandered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
on to where the shade by its coolness was
inviting.</p>

<p>Willoughby attached himself entirely to our
heroine, with whom he already fancied himself
in love. Lord Darlingford walked soberly
beside Jane, who after many relapses of a
hope, fainter at each return, had resigned her
early dream of first and mutual love, and was
now quietly receiving his serious addresses.
She had at length brought her mind to anticipate,
with a placid sort of happiness, the hope
of obtaining for life the companionship and
protection of a friend whom she could respect;
together with the certainty of securing a perfectly
eligible establishment, and thus escaping all
those miseries inflicted by the unfeeling world's
scorn on the poor and the unprotected;&mdash;miseries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
against which her mother and her aunt had so
often warned her.</p>

<p>Louisa was attended by Sir James, her expected
marriage with whom was now the
universal theme. She had herself, however,
by no means made up her mind; she could not
even approach a decision, her meditations on
the subject always ending in a fruitless wish
that Henry were the elder brother.</p>

<p>Madeline, who did not happen to have a
lover present walked and talked with her cousin
Geoffery.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dorothea had been called for as they
passed her door; she was the companion of
Lady Arden.</p>

<p>Arranged in the order we have described,
our party came suddenly upon Alfred, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
where we last left him, and having just brought
his solitary musings to the final summing
up with which we concluded the last
chapter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>


<p>Alfred could not without an appearance of
great singularity avoid joining the party; he
turned, therefore, and making his salutation to
Caroline, and what other recognitions were necessary,
in as hurried a manner as possible, took the
unoccupied side of Madeline. Geoffery saw a
good deal, and suspected more. "Where have
you been all the morning, Alfred?" he said. "We
have had some delightful music at Lady Palliser's."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" replied our hero.</p>

<p>"Yes," added Willoughby, "Lady Caroline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
was so obliging as to try one or two charming
duets, in which her ladyship permitted me to
attempt a part."</p>

<p>Alfred could scarcely credit that he heard
aright&mdash;was it possible!&mdash;could Caroline indeed
be so utterly devoid of feeling? What, but a
few moments after having driven him from her
presence, overwhelmed with despair by her capricious
perfidy? However strangely changed,
however indifferent she had herself become, had
she not even the grace to compassionate the sufferings
she had wilfully inflicted? Could she within
the very same half hour be in such exuberant
spirits that it was necessary to exhaust them by
singing for the amusement of her morning
visitors? Or was it indeed possible, that young
as she was, she had already learned worldly
wisdom sufficient to prefer the possessor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
Arden estates to his landless younger brother?
So indeed it would appear. Had she not last night
danced with Willoughby in preference to himself?&mdash;Had
she not afterwards departed from her
usual line of conduct to waltz with him also?&mdash;This
morning, had not every thought and feeling
undergone an evident and sudden revolution.
That prudential considerations had been strongly
represented to Caroline he made no doubt; it
was highly improbable that such views had
arisen spontaneously in her own mind; but
of what value could the merely fanciful preference
be that could be so easily turned aside?
To believe Caroline worthless cost him a more
cruel pang than even the knowledge that she
was lost to him for ever.</p>

<p>As soon as the Arden family had reached home,
after having left Caroline at Lady Palliser's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
and parted from Lord Darlingford and Sir
James at the door, the sisters began as usual
to banter Alfred about his love; and Lady
Arden observed laughingly, "But you seem to
have quite resigned your post to Willoughby."
Alfred made a strong effort to treat the subject
with seeming carelessness, and replied generally,
that younger brothers had no pretensions.</p>

<p>"That is," replied his mother, "as the lady
may think. And I am sure Willoughby would
be very sorry to interfere with your prospects;
an heiress can be no object to him."</p>

<p>Willoughby looked amazed. Alfred begged
Lady Arden would not treat the subject with
such unnecessary solemnity, and assured his
brother, with an earnestness that surprised the
ladies of the family, that he had not the most
distant intention of ever addressing Lady Caro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>line
Montague, nor the slightest reason to suppose
that if he were guilty of so silly a presumption,
his forwardness would not meet with the
repulse it should deserve.</p>

<p>"I don't know that," said Geoffery; "it must
depend on the share of encouragement a lady
pleases to give."</p>

<p>"Lady Caroline Montague," observed Willoughby,
"is certainly much to be admired; at
the same time," he added, with evident pique,
"I should be sorry, were I ever to enter the
lists among her ladyship's adorers, to owe my
success to being an elder brother, as my mother
would infer!"</p>

<p>The girls persisted in laughing, and declaring
there must have been a lover's quarrel; for
that Alfred did not speak of Lady Caroline
in the least like the way he used to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is certainly a great change," said
Mrs. Dorothea; "every thing appeared to be
going on just as Alfred's best friends could
have wished."</p>

<p>"How busy people make themselves," thought
Willoughby, "but they shall not influence my
conduct."</p>

<p>To avoid the painful topic, Alfred sauntered
into the lawn by one of the open French
windows. He was almost instantly followed
by Willoughby, who took his arm and walked
for some time up and down in silence.</p>

<p>"I wish Alfred you would be candid with
me," said Willoughby at last, "I certainly admire
Lady Caroline Montague, but mine is the
admiration&mdash;the acquaintance of a day&mdash;an
hour. If you are seriously attached, still more,
if the attachment is, as my mother and sisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
seem to think, mutual, tell me so honestly,
and I am sure you will do me the justice to
believe, that had I the vanity to suppose I
could succeed in such an attempt, I would be
the last being in existence to wish to interfere
with your happiness; so far from it, that if
fortune is the obstacle, say so, and I will make
a settlement on you so splendid, as to leave no
room for objection on that head."</p>

<p>Alfred, quite overcome by his brother's generosity,
was unable to articulate; he drew
Willoughby's arm closer to his side in token of
his gratitude, and they walked on a little, till
finding themselves sheltered from the immediate
view of the windows by a drooping
acacia-tree, they paused by a sort of mutual
consent, and Alfred, making an effort to master
his emotion, said&mdash;"I feel Willoughby, if pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>sible,
more gratitude than if I were about to
accept and be made happy by your noble offer.
I feel too," he added, hesitating, "that I&mdash;owe
it to your generous nature to make a confession,
which else I had gladly avoided. I&mdash;I have
been already rejected&mdash;rejected not by Lady
Palliser on the plea of want of fortune, but
by Lady Caroline Montague herself. You are,
therefore, of course&mdash;free&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;" but he
could not bring himself to give the palpable
form of words to the remainder of the inference.</p>

<p>"Rejected already! and by Lady Caroline
herself!" repeated Willoughby. "Thank heaven
then, my interference at least can never
be alleged. What occurred before my arrival
cannot be laid to my charge. This, under
whatever circumstances may arise, will be an
infinite consolation to my mind."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>Alfred did not judge it necessary to correct
the slight error in chronology which his brother
had made, and a protracted silence followed; at
length Willoughby said, "Do you think it probable,
Alfred, that you will be induced to renew
your addresses?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"In that case," said Willoughby, again breaking
the silence, "who may or who may not ultimately
succeed in making themselves acceptable
to Lady Caroline Montague can in no wise
affect your happiness?"</p>

<p>"My happiness," replied Alfred, in a strange
hurried manner, "is quite irrelevant to the present
subject: but I am not, I trust, so selfish
as to feel any desire to condemn a lady to a
life of celibacy, merely because&mdash;but let us lay
aside this painful subject; I shall endeavour as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
quickly as possible to forget all things connected
with it, except, indeed, the feelings of
heartfelt gratitude so justly due to you, my dear
Willoughby."</p>

<p>While this conversation was passing in the
lawn, Geoffery, whom we left in the drawing-room
with the ladies of the family, addressed
Mrs. Dorothea Arden thus:</p>

<p>"So you really think it will be a match
between Alfred and Lady Caroline Montague?"</p>

<p>"I should think so, certainly," replied Mrs.
Dorothea; "his attentions have been very
marked, and have been received with decided
approbation, both by mother and daughter; and
I am sure that he is, poor fellow, very sincerely
attached."</p>

<p>"We all thought it quite settled," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Jane. Her sisters echoed nearly the same sentiment.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt," observed Lady
Arden, "that Alfred would have a right to
consider himself very ill treated, if any objection
to his pretensions were started at this late period."</p>

<p>"There was a great difference, however, last
night," said Louisa, "in Lady Caroline's manner."</p>

<p>"And a still greater this morning," added
Madeline.</p>

<p>"Your ladyship thinks Alfred attached to
Lady Caroline?" asked Geoffrey.</p>

<p>"Unquestionably!" replied Lady Arden.
"If the affair should not go on, it will be a
very serious disappointment to him, I am convinced."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>"And her ladyship received him well up to
last night?" persisted Geoffrey.</p>

<p>"I should certainly say so," Lady Arden
replied.</p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
